In the world premiere of the awe-inspiring installation Spiraling Into Infinity by Amsterdam based artist duo Children of the Light, light is staged as a fleeting yet tangible presence that is playfully roaming the nebulous exhibition space of MU. Shifting colour, speed and direction, the light evokes different moods and modes of being. The soundscape by Jacob Lekkerkerker intensifies your perception of space. Like Matisse making a spontaneous penlight drawing in the air, Children of the Light \u2013 although on a slightly larger scale - do not only represent the visible, but reveal also what lies beyond.We've listed all MU COVID-19 rules for you: read them here. Since the installation can best be experienced when it is dark, we temporarily changed our opening times.

        "en_page_text": "Sleeping is an elusive activity in which reality and reason are abandoned. Could we see the associative stream of images that proceeds in our subconscious at night as a source of wisdom? According to performance duo Boogaerdt/VanderSchoot, it might be the key to a next step in the transformation process of man and her place on this earth.Boogaerdt/VanderSchoot seeks the answers in the collective subconscious that reveals itself in a visual language when we sleep. Enter the dormitory, step out of the tangible world and go on a ritual inward journey to a dreamed reality.Fremdk\u00f6rper is inspired by the sleep temples of the Ancient Greeks. At the time of Parmenides and Pythagoras, about 2500 years ago, philosophers, guided by a priest(ess), gathered wisdom from their subconscious during sleep. The knowledge gained from this incubation practice was considered the basis of society. Western science has its origins in the (dream) oracle. It is based on a forgotten world view consisting of a mixture of disordered and ordered patterns. Divination - a form of soothsaying - and science were once equivalent, and derive from the same source. What was still a unified whole 2000 years ago, has fallen apart into two extremes. Can we reuse these ancient rituals to find a balance again between body and spirit, heaven and earth, inside and outside? To think of mankind no longer as the final goal and summit of evolution, but to search for a new form of co-existence. Away from the old patriarchal society and in harmony with the world around us.Images Header: Annaleen Louwes & second image: Davids Danoss FREMDK\u00d6RPER CREDITSInstallation by Boogaerdt/VanderSchoot, in collaboration with Lotte Goos (dolls), Remco de Jong and Florentijn Boddendijk (sound), Theun Mosk (light).Sleep ceremonies by Klara Alexova & Suzan Boogaerdt (performance), Saskia de Jong (text pieces).

        "en_page_text": "Emotions are the essence of human experience. Love them or hate them: they are interwoven with every aspect of daily life and influence the direction we take as individuals and as a society. They make us human and distinguish us from robots and other machines. Or does the digital age ask for \u2014 or even demand \u2014 a redefinition?At this point in time, machines are getting smarter, even intelligent. Does this mean that the emotional intelligence gap between humans and machines also grows narrower? And \u2014 from a slightly different perspective \u2014 are we still in control of our emotions; love, empathy, hate, fear? Or are we losing grip of how we really feel in these transformative times, and are we not only supported, but also influenced, surveyed and manipulated by technology? Real Feelings: Emotion and Technology presents the works of 20 international contemporary artists who challenge, provoke and explore the accelerating interactions between technology and emotions: from the highs and the lows to the pains and the pleasures. Join us for an open-ended investigation of a theme at the core of these tech-driven, COVID-19-ruled times.Technology has begun to engage with our emotions as never before. In fact, these technologies are even creating new feelings, for some of which we haven't yet found the words to describe them with. Social media, AI, robotics, biometrics, Virtual Reality: they are collating and assessing our emotions in multiple ways. Big tech companies try to control the way we behave by triggering the release of dopamine through apps, fed by biometric data. Our heartbeat, perspiration, speech and body language are being monitored by smart watches, trackers, apps and webcams that play a more and more prominent role in our lives. Anxiety and depression associated with screen time become more of a constant in the lives of young children than interpersonal activity and exchanges. At the same time, in the past year, technology has been the glue that has kept us connected with each other, enabling us to share despite the social distancing and lack of physical connection. This physicality is such an important part of communication, which in hindsight has been taken for granted up until the point it wasn't possible anymore. Our world is flooded with digital technology and these devices have literally become extensions of ourselves: robots are entering homes, schools and hospitals as smart assistants in empathic roles and to fulfil sexual needs, smart devices take care of our needs \u2013 we are communicating more with our technology than with one another. Like Sherry Turkle states, 'technology seduces us by making emotions 'easy' when offering relationships without the complexity of being face to face'. We are willing to cede to technology the messiness, complexity and sheer time it takes to understand, let alone manage human emotions. The question rises: how will technology alter social behaviour; how will we be intimate, honest and present with one another? Work: Solitary Survival Raft - Lucy McRae.

        "en_page_text": "This year, the Bio Art & Design (BAD) Award celebrates its tenth anniversary. Specially for this unique edition, we talked to the three winners of 2020 and nine previous BAD Award winners - one from each year. All are showing new or recent work in the group exhibition Evolutionaries. In 12 video portraits, artists, designers and scientists who have shown their works at MU in the previous years take you along their fascination for working with living matter, biological processes and ecological systems. Together they underline how meaningful a prize like the BAD Award is for the collaboration between art and science.Furthermore, we present a short film (12 min) in which MU director & curator Angelique Spaninks, head of the BAD Award jury William Myers and previous winners take us along 10 years of BAD Award and explain what the award & the collaboration between art and science means for them. Together they portray the unique character of the BAD Award and tell us about the new possibilities the life sciences have to offer. Not only for the fields of art and science, but for the whole of society.10 YEARS OF BAD AWARDMEET THE WINNERS | 12 INTERVIEWSSissel Marie Tonn | Winner 2020Artist Sissel Marie Tonn, in collaboration with researchers Leslie Heather and Juan Garcia Vallejo, presents Becoming a Sentinel Species. The intriguing, experimental science-fiction film follows two researchers on a quest to explore and amplify their own bodies' sensitivity to microplastics on a cellular level. Sissel's works always return to the question at the core of ecological thought: Where do we perceive our bodies to end, and the environment to begin? Dasha Tsapenko | Winner 2020Designer & architect Dasha Tsapenko created Fur_tilize, together with researcher Han W\u00f6sten. The five grown 'fur' coats offer a speculative prototype of a value-building form of fashion, in which a garment evolves through phases of growing: producing materials as well as food for consumption. The coats, made of hemp fiber, show five live-use cycles of one garment and illustrate how different species support each other, increasing the value of a particular piece over time. Nadine Botha | Winner 2020Research designer Nadine Botha, in collaboration with skin infections specialist Henry de Vries, presents The Orders of the Undead. The project explores the colonial origins of contemporary narratives of infectious disease, race, violence, and apocalypses through zombie films. Through four short films, the work draws attention to the war-like language and metaphors of contagion that are used to 'other' people. Jalila Essa\u00efdi | Winner 2010Jalila won a BAD Award in 2010 with the project 2.6g 329m/s, also known as Bulletproof Skin. This year, her work Double Edged is on show at MU. Jalila is specialized in the fields of bio-based materials and bio-art and is the founder of BioArt Laboratories, one of the leading artistic development institutes in this field in the Netherlands.The Center for Genomic Gastronomy | Winner 2011The artist-led think tank Center for Genomic Gastronomy examines the biotechnologies and biodiversity of human food systems. Over the years, they participated multiple times in the bio art and design exhibitions at MU. The first time was in 2011, when they won a BAD Award with the project Eat Less, Live More, & Pray for Beans. This year, they present O.F.F.I.C.E: an interactive space that combines ten years of their research.Charlotte Jarvis | Winner 2012In 2012, Charlotte won a BAD Award with Ergo Sum. Her practice often utilizes living cells and DNA: amongst others she has grown her own tumor, recorded music onto DNA and she has seen her heartbeat outside her body. This year, her ongoing work In Posse is on show at MU. Together with professor Susana Chuva de Sousa Lopes (LUMC) she works towards creating viable semen from her own female cells. In collaboration with FutureFest, Charlotte also made a film version of In Posse.\u0160pela Petric | Winner 2014\u0160pela Petric won a BAD Award in 2014. This year, she presents PL'AI: the third work in the series PLANT-MACHINE. The installation showcases a playful interaction between a cucumber plant and a robot, lasting for several months as the plant grows. The installation embraces the notion of play as an ontological or natural condition of all living bodies, including plants. The act of playing, unlike games, which are limited by clear rules or goals, reflects the uncertain character of existence and is therefore at the heart of self-discovery. Agi Haines | Winner 2015In 2015, Agi won a BAD Award with the project Drones with Desires. During Evolutionaties, her work Alter-Terrestrial is shown. The work illustrates how beings, at one time having been earth terrestrials, might have to change to the point that reintegration on earth is no longer possible. They are 'alter terrestrials': not quite terrestrial (being of or from the earth), yet not quite extra-terrestrial either (being of outside earth).Cecilia Jonsson | Winner 2016Contemporary Diagram - Berlin by former BAD Award winner Cecilia Jonsson presents the visual effects of bacteria, which corroded a series of iron plates over the course of being stimulated by sounds and music. In 2016, Cecilia won a BAD Award with the internationally acclaimed project Haem, for which a small amount of iron was extracted out of human placentas and turned into a compass needle. In her interview, Cecilia tells you all about her fascination for elements. Xandra van der Eijk | Winner 2017In 2017, Xandra won a BAD Award with her project Seasynthesis. This year, Ghost Reef is on show at MU. In her practice, Xandra connects art, ecology, and activism. She has developed a distinct research methodology demonstrated in a broad body of work, incorporating theory, fieldwork, documentation methods, and material development in her practice. Each of her projects deals with a key ecological issue, and how it is exposed by the passing of time.Ani Liu | Winner 2018No regrets for what you haven't been, Be the ghost you want to see in the machine: in 2018, Ani Liu won a BAD Award with the project that probably has the longest BAD Award title ever. In her practice, Ani examines the reciprocal relationships between science, technology and their influence on human subjectivity, culture, and identity. Reoccurring themes include gender politics, biopolitics, labour, nostalgia and sexuality. This year she presents the three works Small Inconveniences, Maternity Menswear and the film Mind Controlled Sperm. Michael Sedbon | Winner 2019Michael Sedbon explores digital networked technologies and systems through their convergence with non-human intelligence, like plants, unicellular organisms, insects, and bacteria. In 2019, Michael won an award with his large, complex installation CMD: Experiments in Bio Algorithmic Politics. During Evolutionaries he presents the 2.0 version of the project, which is based on a possible future in which humans are directed by diffused digital networks that form a governing artificial intelligence.",

This year's exhibition has an extra festive ring to it, as we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the BAD Award.Evolutionaries offers a thrilling survey of the complex ways in which our shared concepts of nature, identity, culture and all that is living are fluid and in flux. The BAD Award projects, as ever, go beyond science communication. They zoom in on aesthetic and often also ethical aspects enabled by discoveries in the life sciences and the applications of biotechnology: from the possibility of same-sex biological parents and the colonial origin of zombie stories in relation to virology, to what can be learned from watching a plant play tag with a machine.Bio art and design, as practiced by this talented pool of international artists, take on the vastness of our polluted seas as well as the disquiet of the souls sensitive to the weight of collective injustice. To the well-tuned ear their work cries for revolution and evolution simultaneously.Xandra van der Eijk - Ghost Reef (2020)Ani Liu - The Simulator (2019).

An imaginary human guinea pig takes on the task of becoming a sentinel species by introducing microplastics in her blood. By activating old immunological alarmsystems it recalls latent ancient memories of a common origin in the primordial sea. An immersive audiovisual installation invites the audience to connect with the fluid reality of their own bodies and, perhaps, to become sentinel species too.Fur_tilizeDasha Tsapenko, in collaboration with Han W\u00f6sten (Microbiology Research Group, UU Utrecht)Dasha Tsapenko develops a collection of garments for the future that introduces an alternative value system into the fashion industry by looking at agriculture for inspiration. Five coats show the five distinct cycles of our apparel and illustrate how the value of a specific piece increases with every cycle. With its speculative character, the project seeks to challenge the current linear consumption-oriented fashion system and the way we produce our food. Image: Hanneke WetzerThe Orders of the UndeadNadine Botha, in collaboration with Henry de Vries (Department of Infectious Diseases, Public Health Service (GGD), Amsterdam, and Department of Dermatology, Amsterdam University Medical Centres (AUMC))Nadine Botha's project is a participatory research proposal into public health, stigma, othering and viruses, by revisiting one of the most lucrative topical stories in popular culture: zombies. Through an immersive and interactive green screen setup enhanced with augmented reality, participants can re-embody the archetypical zombie film and disentangle the tale of infectious social othering it propagates. The project provokes thought about who the other actually is in stories about outbreaks and public health that currently dominate our everyday reality.Image: Hanneke Wetzer",

Inspired by Mieke Gerritzen's upcoming book Help Your Self about the ever-increasing popularity of the self-help industry, we focus on the creative strategies and techniques we can develop ourselves, and how to share these with others. At the same time, the Academy is a place of critical reflection on the malleability of the self. Is it actually necessary to constantly improve or (re)design ourselves, and if so: on whose terms?

The 2020 crop of talents has now been visualized in one-minute film portraits. These portraits can be seen from 18 September to 22 November in the 'Talent Tours' exhibition at MU, Strijp-S Eindhoven.Talent Tours provides insight into the thinking and practice of 39 emerging design talents, each of whom is concerned with topical social themes. What are their motives, their doubts and ambitions, and what values do they put first in their work? Angelique Spaninks, chair of the Talent Development grant programme advisory committee: 'Talent does not live in a vacuum; it relates to the world, allows itself to be inspired and rebels, finds its own focus and knows how to translate and express it. This is the only way to make a professional contribution to the field, and for a young maker to create a meaningful position for themselves in the work field.'Social designer and bio-artist Kuang-Yi Ku, for example, outlines oppressive future scenarios in which he confronts the public with the question of what is still acceptable when it comes to the influence of medical science on our lives. Marwan Magroun made a photo series and film in which he wants to refute the stigma that rests on fathers with a migrant background. And Milou Voorwinden is conducting research into 3D weaving: a technique that can bring about a considerable increase in sustainability in the fashion industry.Livestreams during Dutch Design Week 2020During the DDW2020, daily livestreams were broadcasted.

        "en_page_text": "While the corona virus is creating a new reality around us, MU has found a way to virtually lead you into an array of alternative worlds. Especially now, imaginary worlds can be a relief. But the queer, utopian, dystopian, germinating, irreconcilable worlds that MU discloses online as Worlding Worlds at mu.nl, offer more than just distraction. In a choir of critical and upbeat voices, thirteen artists and designers question dominant views, opposing them with unexpected possibilities and creating the space that can be hard to find in society as we know it. Watch the videos from the exhibition at our Worlding Worlds Vimeo Channel.Admittedly, the use of 'to world' as a verb \u2013 I world, you world, we world \u2013 is an elusive phenomenon. Common sense soon makes you wonder what is being worlded in the first place, and by whom? When the word 'worlding' was introduced in twentieth-century philosophy, it was meant to describe the world's meaningful unfolding in time. That might sound rather dense, but thanks to the rise of self-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, it has become easier to imagine a world that is in a constant state of unfolding.Few artists place worlding at the heart of their practice like Ian Cheng. He is constantly looking for ways to create worlds that continue to thrive on their own, once their designer has withdrawn. In The Emissary's Guide to Worlding, that can be downloaded for free during the exhibition, he concludes that a world will exist as long as there are people invested in it. We need to be involved, amused, thrilled, amazed or mesmerized. And worlding can take many shapes.In Paysages Possibles of Joanie Lemercier for instance, a simple drawing device is being directed by a tiny computer and an algorithm. Line by line, a landscape is taking shape, sheet by sheet, until the wall is filled with a graphic world of mountains and water. Meanwhile, life takes centre stage in Eye of the Dream by David OReilly, developing in all its complexity from the Big Bang all the way to our modern age like a breath-taking dance, over and over, and never the same. Viviane Komati's animation Valentine in Things City takes this cycle to a logical conclusion in an immense storage facility populated by drones, conveyers, lifts, logistic robots and packages \u2013 a staggering choreography that excludes all human life until a girl arrives, looking for a lost delivery.?More dystopian is Flesh Nest, a series of animations made by Andrew Thomas Huang that evokes a post-apocalyptic nightmare of a digital purgatory, inspired by paintings of Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel. There are precedents, like the planet Winter in The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin, from 1969, where sexless people may choose to be male or female in their fertile periods. Despite growing challenges, however, the binary image of mankind is very slow to dissolve. How problematic this is, and how threatening, becomes tangible in \u201cRessurection Land\u201d Pro League by Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley (@ladydangfua), where a team?of black transgenders needs to protect their resurrected ancestors from trans tourism by 'the consumers'. Time and again, your motives as a viewer are being questioned. What are you doing in this 'pro black, pro trans' space? Many of our inherited power systems (patriarchy, capitalism, colonialism, etc.) see humans as rulers over the earth and everything that lives in it; an anthropocentric view of the world that urgently needs to be overturned. In Staying with the Trouble, from 2016, Donna Haraway describes worlding as a concern of all critters, large and small. This awareness that we are all connected in myriad ways, that we make the world and give it meaning in mutual dependence, can also be found in Host, an installation by Amanda Baum & Rose Leahy. In collaboration with Richard Beckett they created pillows, wall objects and glass spheres full of bacteria and microbes, purposely bringing us in close, intimate contact with the micro-organisms we already carry in and on our bodies anyway. Liam Young comes up with a completely different proposal. In his Planet City all people on Earth retreat to one giant city of 7 billion inhabitants,?so that the rest of the planet can be returned to nature. Is this a sustainable way of living? What would a world look like that is not designed according?to dystopian western scenarios??In a different way, these themes also appear in Kordea Jatafa Henry's Earth Mother, Sky Father. Street dancer Storyboard P pacifies a techno-demon in 2030 Africa, when the continent is no longer exploited by China or the West, but uses its rare earth minerals for its own growth and development instead. On a smaller scale, growth is central to Weightless Collaboration by Soft Bodies, a virtual garden where you can collaborate with someone else to work the soil, water the plants and enjoy the fruits of your labour. The experience of a shared virtual reality anticipates new ways of living and working together for people who are separated by physical distance. Stream City of Design Academy alumnus St\u00e9phane LAB imagines our future habitat in a virtual urban landscape, allowing you to fly through the sky in a wingsuit. Ephemeral, anarchistic, almost transparent, it values experience and collaboration with others over individual possessions. Still, world building is not only about construction. Worlding, as a continuous unfolding of the world, also holds an element of destruction. You can sense this clearly in two of the most personal works in Worlding Worlds. Ferenj, The Installation by Ainslee Alem Robson, exists of point clouds based on crowd-sourced images of Addis Ababa and the Cleveland restaurant of Robson's parents. As you move around in a virtual space, you see a world continuously appear and disappear like intangible recollections.?The installation Flotsam Jetsam, Lagan and Derelict made by Iranian-born Mehraneh Atashi, is built of memories, stories, found objects and animations. She sees the work as a non-ending state of becoming: \u201ca landscape of disruption, that carries the potential of transformation in it.\u201dCurator Angelique SpaninksParticipating artistsAinslee Alem Robson, Andrew Thomas Huang, Baum & Leahy, David OReilly, Ian Cheng, Joanie Lemercier, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley (@ladydangfua), Liam Young, Mehraneh Atashi, St\u00e9phane Borel, Soft Bodies (Paula Strunden & John Cruwys), Viviane Komati",

The exhibition was made possible through the generous support of Art Center Nabi (Seoul); Rhizome of the New Museum (New York); and the concerted efforts by 12 institutions around the world. The exhibition is available online from 30 March 2020. Visit the exhibition here.Due to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak rapidly raging throughout the world, we are experiencing an unprecedented historical moment, and social and economic routines have been interrupted, including cultural programming. More than ever, art remains an essential force to galvanize and rejuvenate. In lieu of a physical exhibition restrained by the lockdown, Chronus Art Center sent out an open call to the international media art community in early February to initiate a special online exhibition as a response to the current uncertainty and a time of anxiety. The proposal has since received committed responses from the international community.Titled \u201cWe=Link: Ten Easy Pieces,\u201d alluding to the American actor Jack Nicholson's iconic movie Five Easy Pieces with a subtle twist on WeChat, the popular Chinese social media platform, it will be exhibited online in collaboration with a network of other hosting institutions. The works presented in this exhibition are network native, exploring the potential of mobile technologies, particularly with a creative and critical appropriation of various social media platforms. In conjunction with this online exhibition, CAC also aims to use this opportunity to recapitulate the importance of net art practice, which was crucial in contributing to early discourse on internet culture and constitutive during the formative years of new media art as a genre, continuing to play a vital role in shaping the dynamics of an ever more pervasively networked society.The title \u201cWe=Link: Ten Easy Pieces\u201d denotes a community of solidarity as a network of empowerment. The reference to Five Easy Pieces prompts an evocation of an implicit existential anxiety, a sense of estrangement and soul finding: Ten Uneasy Pieces indeed. On the other hand, the title \u201cWe=Link\" elicits a silver lining\u2014a streak of hope to carry on.Rather than an explicit outcry against the current public health crisis, this online project addresses a general state of humanity that is under pressing peril of natural and social disruptions and precariousness, demonstratively manifested in the coronavirus outbreak, which is partially the cause of the magnitude of the virus itself and partially beholden to a failure of governance.Chronus Art Center (CAC)Established in 2013, Chronus Art Center (CAC) is China's first nonprofit art organization dedicated to the presentation, research / creation and scholarship of media art. CAC with its exhibitions, residency oriented fellowships, lectures and workshop programs and through its archiving and publishing initiatives, creates a multifaceted and vibrant platform for the discourse, production and dissemination of media art in a global context. CAC is positioned to advance artistic innovation and cultural awareness by critically engaging with media technologies that are transforming and reshaping contemporary experiences.www.chronusartcenter.org",

But the tide is turning: a new wave of Computer Grrrls presents itself in MU. The exhibition highlights the historical role women played in the development of computer science but it also offers self\u00ad defence instructions against technology, outlines the relationship between gender and algorithms and reveals dazzling visions of the future. 22 artists obliterate the existing representation of women and computers. They de\u00adcolonialise the internet and reclaim their place in the technological domain. Meanwhile, with each work, they create room for new forms and ideas, for dialogue and reflection.

Whether he stands within an inch of a rapidly rotating, man-sized circular saw, or holds up a board against a thundering waterfall for several minutes, in the end something essential has changed. Something was accomplished. Hidden behind his exhausting, apparently pointless actions are personal emotions and contemplations, a yearning to connect with an environment and a society where he, as an artist and individual, remains a strange phenomenon. In the works he shows in MU, Li Binyuan often measures himself against the water; element of recovery, of uncontrollable violence, of rhythm, transformation and reflection. With each performance, carefully thought out or created spontaneously on his travels, he stages a universal experience. A necessity. You don't need to understand the contemporary Chinese context to know: this is someone doing what he has to do.",

Meanwhile, we humans play an increasingly indelible role in the shaping of life. In the exhibition ReShape, on show in MU from 30 November, 2018 to 10 March 2019, artists and designers imagine the continuous transformation of life.ReShape presents the three winning projects of the Bio Art & Design Award 2018, developed in collaboration with leading Dutch researchers in the life sciences. They are shown alongside recent works of nine other international artists and designers that share a focus on the theme of mutation and transformation. Areas of investigation include our place in the food chain, the digital reproduction of artificial life, worldwide corn varieties and the geological consequence of breeding a pink race of chickens.The exhibition is curated by William Myers and Angelique Spaninks.BAD Award is a collaboration with ZonMw, NWO - Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek & BioArt Laboratories.More info about BAD Awards: http://www.badaward.nl/Participating artistsBaum & Leahy, Yiyun Chen, Pleun van Dijk, Anna Dumitriu, Kuang Yi Ku, Ani Liu, Jon McCormack, (Non)human (Non)sense Collective, Basse Stittgen, Studio Arvid & Marie, The Center for Genomic Gastronomy, Uli Westphal.

Still, Create Out Loud wouldn't do justice to its name if it lacked the courage to reinvent itself.In order to do just that, we challenge the boundaries of the familiar talk show on three of these evenings, together with What If Lab. Several designers will give the concept a make-over, a differing format or a surprising pop-up arrangement. All meant to elevate your experience and perception and to get you involved in the conversation in a more intense and intimate way. Create Out Loud will be presented by Isolde Hallensleben and recorded on audio only. Create Out Loud is a collaboration with Dutch Design Week.

These critical issues are dramatically politicised by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, at MU, from 11 May to 8 July. A world premiere, the four-channel video installation T3511 tells the story of a biohacker who procures saliva from an unknown donor and proceeds to analyse their DNA and grow their cells. In letters to the donor that are increasingly intimate, she confesses her growing obsession and explains how she obtains her information. The work, a collaboration with artist and filmmaker Toshiaki Ozawa, draws the viewer into an emerging world of ubiquitous genomic sequencing, biobanking, and commodification of human biological materials.Dewey-Hagborg's adjacent installation, Probably Chelsea, shows just how much room for interpretation DNA allows. Chelsea is Chelsea Manning, the U.S. whistle-blower who spent seven years in prison for exposing civilian deaths and torture in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Since the time of her sentencing and gender transition Chelsea's image was suppressed by the prison until she was released in May 2017. Dewey-Hagborg, however, created thirty 3D-printed portraits of Chelsea, while she was incarcerated, based on her DNA, to give her a face \u2013 or rather a multitude of probable faces.

        "en_page_text": "We are living in interesting times \u2013 and what a mixed blessing it is! The optimism that swept across the western world after the fall of the Berlin Wall has been replaced by bewilderment. 'What the [beep/fuck/f**k] is happening?!' would sum it up nicely. In a response to political turmoil and the return of History as we know it, American artist Brad Downey shifts his attention from the street to the state. Reverse Culture Shock, at MU from Friday 2 March to Sunday 29 April, is his most engaged exhibition to date because, as he says, sometimes poetry is not enough.Notorious for his subversive pranks and minimalist interventions in public space, Downey has used the streets as his studio for years. Ash trays, lampposts, flower pots, traffic signs, tiles, bicycles, phone booths, benches, trash bins, demarcation lines \u2013 anything can become a work of art overnight if you look past its fixed, inevitable function. His art has always been an invitation for people to make a change and the works he is now showing in MU are no exception. Their scope however, is no longer the same.Take The Non-Objective World for example. In 2013, Downey paired a shopping cart to a city bike for a project in Prague; the result could be read as a comment on the commercial motives of city bike schemes or just a hilarious way to repurpose 'free' materials but it was not profoundly political. Today, he is mounting a model of Tatlin's Tower on top of a tank in reference to the Russian annexation of Crimea and Moscow's continuous meddling in the eastern Ukraine.The futuristic tower, designed in 1919 by Ukrainian-Russian architect Vladimir Tatlin as a monument for the Third Communist International, symbolised the optimism and aspirations of the early revolution. It was never built however, and the hope it represented was soon lost when Communism became synonymous for state control. In that sense, the work also refers to the Hungarian uprising in 1956 that ended with Russian tanks in the streets of Budapest. Downey plans to drive the 'Tatlin tank' to the Ukraine \u2013 to bring the message home.Something similar is happening with Fence Hacks Five, a number of works from 2014/5, for which the artist cut four boards from a picket fence to form an opening, using the wood to frame a picture of the result. Showing a barrier at the US-Mexican border that received the same treatment in 2017, obviously gives the work a whole new significance. We also get a better idea of what Downey means with the exhibition title. To him, having lived in London and Berlin for many years, the America that elected Donald Trump has changed beyond recognition. And let's not turn a blind eye to the isolationist tendencies in Europe like Brexit or the Ankara refugee deal.Reverse Culture Shock becomes more intricate with My Mind Always Drifts, a series of magazines and posters Downey collected in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for the censored images they contain. Anything indecent is blocked out by staff of the National Media Council. The images inspired a fashion collection made especially for the exhibition in collaboration with Jess Oberlin. The creations will be presented regularly during the exhibition in, a fashion show that coincides with the five daily Islamic prayers. For Downey, who often travels and works in Muslim countries, the collection is a way to turn censorship and oppression into something empowering. At the same time, it is hard not to think of the thinly veiled islamophobia of Trump's travel ban or the virulent anti-immigration rhetoric heard across Europe. Yes, it's personal: isn't that why we care in the first place? If, however, politics is not your cup of tea, you can still enjoy Reverse Culture Shock for its poetry and its thoughtful observations disguised as humoristic statements. Treading, a video from 2015, of a dog walking on a treadmill in the streets of Kazan, becomes a monument for the mindless. This dog is a good-natured animal, large, docile, that appears to enjoy the exercise and hardly notices its environment \u2013 just like passers-by tend to ignore the dog. [Disclaimer: no dogs were harmed in the making of this video.]Impossible to miss are the crickets chirping in the exhibition space. Just the males though: they are the ones making all the noise, scraping one wing across the other to attract a female cricket or to scare off their rivals. As if a few hundred crickets aren't loud enough, Downey bugs their terrarium and amplifies the recording. Proverb about Machines might reflect on anything from social media to machismo or the human condition. Aren't we all just trying to be heard in an increasingly crowded world? And what do we have to say? Another new work that's loud and clear is Teach me to Forget, a tall stack of steel cylinders that comes crashing down randomly, only to resurrect itself like a push-button toy, over and over again. Everything inevitably collapses at one point or another and the title seems to suggest that we are bound to repeat our mistakes, but at the same time the work is a reminder that nature, man, democracy, civilisation \u2013 or whatever it is the tower stands for \u2013 is far more resilient than we might think. [Soundtrack: the 1997 Chumbawamba song 'Tubthumping': I get knocked down, but I get up again; You're never gonna keep me down.] This is not a pessimistic exhibition; it's a call to arms. Control, ownership and our ability to change the established order have always been part of Downey's work. In MU he cranks up the volume. On show 2 March until 29 April 2018 Opening 2 March from 7 PM, Brad will give a guided tour at 7:30 PM, the performance My Mind Always Drifts takes place at 8:07 PM.Entrance opening \u20ac 5,- (including 1 drink), students \u20ac 3,-, free for We Are Public members.SpecialsSaturday 3 March 11:00 AM - 8:09 PMThe first Saturday after the official opening MU will be open until 8:09 PM with a special evening opening.

Time can be seen as simultaneously binding us, through heredity, and separating us, by death, across generations. And then at the smallest, quantum scale, time seems to mock us, by behaving illogically and entangling all matter over vast distances. The arts have long embraced time through forms like video and performance or, in the case of much bio art and design, explored it through birth, growth, rot, decay, and the cycles of whole ecological systems. With many of the works in the exhibition, time and life are examined simultaneously, acknowledging our human limitation of a lifetime, taking stock of our collective impact, and also gazing in awe at the immensity of what has come before and what will, inevitably, follow us all. Life Time presents the winning projects of the Bio Art and Design Award 2017, developed in collaboration with leading Dutch researchers in the life sciences, alongside several recent works that share a focus on the theme of time. The works reflect on, demonstrate, or even contest advances in life sciences research. They also probe time and life in the realms of the oceans, under the earth, in our minds, and in our cells.

        "en_page_text": "When do we ever blush or shout in public? When do we give attention, enjoy or cry for all to see? Can we still be intimate with ourselves and with others while the world is watching? And if so: what does this intimacy look like? Is this how we want it or do we long for something else; for different forms of expression, less (unwritten) rules, more room to show others who we are and how we feel? That is what the Embassy of Intimacy, part of this years first World Design Event and curated by Angelique Spaninks of MU and designer Tom Loois, is all about. In this Embassy three intimate spheres of influence converge: that of bodies, things and spaces.Intimacy is highly elusive. Situated as it is somewhere along the tension between thehead and the heart, between reason and emotion, hardware and software, publicand private. It is human but not necessarily individualistic; it is aboutconnecting and gauging the distance. This is where both curators see opportunities. Combining an analytical approach with creative and practical qualities, they put expressions of intimacy centre stageby making them more explicit, shared and possibly even rewriteable. Besides that they try to crystallise the most intimate immateriality into objects, appliances and even services. A key strategy they apply is performance, because it is a means to make manners, habits and emotions like shame or passion explicitly clear.Participants: Arnon Grunberg, Chan Chiao Chun, Circus Engelbregt, Dries Verhoeven, Familiar Faces, Julian Hetzel, Kim Saarinen, Lauren McCarthy, Sam Scheurman , The Secret Cooky Factory, Design Academy studenten Man and Food en Man and Well-Being, Suzy van Staveren & Afra Eisma, The One Minutes curated by Next Nature Network, Victoria Romp, Jante Wortel.Curated by: Tom Loois & Angelique SpaninksWhere MUWhen 21 - 29 October, 11.00 - 18.00 h PROGRAMSaturday 21 October 12.00 \u2013 13.00 | The Future of Intimacy door Jeroen van Mastrigt | AA House, Klokgebouw Strijp SWednesday 25 October 18.00 - 20.00 | Create out Loud #4 Tom Loois | MUThursday 26 October 13:00 \u2013 14:30 | The Familiair Stranger, a workshop by Tom Loois & Manon van Hoeckel | NatlabFor the complete program of the Embassy of Intimacy, please check the World Design Event website.Press release (EN) - Photosheet",

Each day, the digital and physical become more integrated \u2013 but how does this effect our experience and how do we express the new, augmented reality? These are the questions addressed by Materialising the Internet, in MU from 6 October to 12 November.Over 20 international artists and designers turn the internet into something tangible. Transposing virtual relationships into real life or running away with the digital representation of the real world they demonstrate the incomprehensible fact that virtual and real are no longer two separate spheres.Buy your scratch cards at MU for a chance to win up to twenty thousand followers or take a sentimental journey through Geocities' history \u2013 back to the days when things were less complicated. See what an aura reading reveals about your smartphone or lose yourself in the intoxicating 3D-prose of the Additivist Cookbook. Social, absurd, critical, formal or metaphorical these work have at least two things in common: a concise analysis of our times and the heart-wrenching transiency of any perspectives on a yet unimaginable future.Participating artists: Morehshin Allahyari, Jip de Beer, Dennis de Bel, Joshua Citarella, Alyssa Davis & Moises Sanabria (ART404), Dries Depoorter, Julien Deswaef, Antonio Esparza, Tom Galle, Mieke Gerritzen, Joey Holder, Matthew Hollings, Michelle Kasprzak, Kuang-Yi Ku, Jan Robert Leegte, Jeroen van Loon, Lauren McCarthy, Kyle McDonald, Brenna Murphy, Roel Roscam Abbing, Matthew Plummer Fernandez, Daniel Rourke, Brad Troemel, Clement Valla, Richard Vijgen, Valerie van Zuijlen.Curators: Nadine Roestenburg & Angelique Spaninks.Where MUWhen 6 October - 12 November 2017Opening 6 October 8 PM (entrance \u20ac5,- including 1 drink)SPECIALS 6 October 8PM Guided tour by curators and artists during the opening. 6 October - 12 November Netflix & Chill Airbnb Room.

Discipline may sound unconnected in mineral-rich South Kivu with all its self-declared authorities, bribery and shady trading. But if you take some more distance, you'll see hundreds of miners hacking away at the earth, labouring to collect coltan and cassiterite. You see how the minerals find their way to processing plants and electronics factories in China. Observe how the smartphones and laptops end up in the hands of billions of people world-wide. Through the components in our devices Congo connects us, makes us part of a 24/7 rhythm of work and play\u2014we're plugged in, complicit, disciplined by consumption.Avant Tout, Discipline, in MU from 14 July to 17 September presents recent works by Revital Cohen and Tuur van Balen, including the premiere of their latest film Trapped in the Dream of the Other.

        "en_page_text": "In forty years, graffiti has grown from a local New York subculture into a worldwide phenomenon with its own heroes and business models. Embraced as urban decoration or buffed by all means, graffiti has escaped a slow death, mainly thanks to the internet. Actions in the real world are increasingly carried out and documented with their digital distribution in mind, leading to refreshing self-reflection and an emphasis on the performative nature of writing.Don't tell the taggers, but graffiti has evolved into a mature, varied artform that doesn't shy away from difficult themes and that combines resistance against repression with a contagious hacker mentality. Meanwhile, the kick of illegality continues to be an important motivation, inextricably linked to kudos and street credibility.??With #ViralVandals MU presents an exhibition about the second life of graffiti. Going virtually viral will replace the street in the quest for even greater visibility. New forms of expression emerge and the DNA of the scene changes irreversibly.

The starting point for this project was a massive database of photos taken by cleaning companies hired between 2005 and 2013 by the municipality of Eindhoven, a medium sized Dutch city known for its industrial heritage and Philips factories. The cleaning companies were commissioned to remove graffiti and stickers from municipal property in the public space. As evidence for their work they took two photos at every job: one before cleaning and one after. During these eight years a staggering 50,000 images were archived.When the authors were able to seize this bizarre archive, they quickly appreciated the historic value. The database is an inventory of both the graffiti and sticker culture in Eindhoven, as well as a municipal struggle with the ambivalent problem of vandalism versus the acceptance of subcultures. But it also shows the city as a place where a diversity of people leave their marks behind.Where MU container at Plug-In-City, Strijp-SWhen May 5th - Juyly 2nd, 2017Special on Friday June 16, from 17:00 beer & book presentation.",

To find your way back out into the light, you must surrender to the unknown.Door into the Dark is a compelling documentary experience about what it means to be lost in an era of infinite information. It is a combination of a radio play, GPS technology and immersive theatre. Digital technology rarely felt so natural.\u201cI found Door into the Dark to be a transformative experience. When I exited, I had a whole new relationship to my body and my other senses. I have been through many immersive experiences at festivals and Door intos the Dark definitely stands out as one of the most powerful.

What if animals, plants, objects and technologies can represent their own interests?Welcome to the Anthropocene: for the first time in the history of the planet one species (mankind) has become a driving force of development of the earth's climate and atmosphere. In this new age, man faces the challenge of climate change, a hyper-problem so vast and profound that we can hardly grasp its dimensions. For this reason, Thijs Middeldorp and Joost Janmaat (Partizan Publik) have convened the Parliament of Things: an upgrade for our thinking, a new step for our imagination and new ways to discuss man and nature.In the MU containers at Plug-In-City, opposite the Onder de Leidingstraat, The Parliament of Things will have ample space to advocate the emancipation of animals and objects. Mankind has reached the end of an anthropocentric era and the duality between culture and nature becomes obscured. We share this world with many, so why would we not admit all animals and things to our parliament? And what would vacuum cleaners and fish have to say to this?

Together with statuettes like the Venus of Willendorf the toy is hard evidence that physicality and sex have sparked our imagination ever since the Stone Age. It also shows that sexuality can be shaped; it is an experience embedded in stories and images that have been changing throughout the ages.In today's erotic landscape, dominated by porn and commerce, co-curators Sanne Muiser and Tom Loois often miss the kind of spontaneity and inventiveness that can make sex such good fun. So they asked (more than) 30 artists and designers for alternative visions: more playful, vulnerable, more original. The result is For Play, a titillating exhibition in MU from October 7th until November 13th.During the Dutch Design Week the video-installation Guilty Landscapes by Dries Verhoeven will be on show as part of the exhibition.

We separate our waste, put solar panels on our roofs and we just wait and see if there's any need for more drastic measures. Our perspective on the weather and the climate has changed however, as you can see in MU from 1 July to 25 September, where the exhibition Weather or Not zooms in how we experience the elements.Sun, wind and rain enter the exhibition space in unexpected, poetic ways. Measurements and weather in uences are translated into images, movement and sound. The weather becomes something more personal, more tangible. As our amazement grows, so does the feeling of human insigni dance versus the complexity and unpredictability of the climate system: we set things in motion but we clearly can't oversee the consequences. Meanwhile, come rain or shine, MU continues to keep a weather eye on any relevant developments!Over the past year MU has already played outside at Strijp S. In our own containers at Plug in City there were several exhibitions under the titel Weather or Not. Reason enough for a nice show this summer in the MU space at Strijp S with the recurring theme: the weather.Participating ArtistsNiels Bakkerus, David Bowen, Commonplace Studio, Aernoudt Jacobs, Esther Kokmeijer, Martijn Koomen, Aliki van der Kruijs, Jelle Mastenbroek, Alistair McClymont, Gideon Mendel, Berndnaut Smilde, Rob Sweere, Prof. Paolo Di Trapani/Coelux and Rihards Vitols.Co-curator: Hanneke WetzerMore information?

Zooming in on digital networks and developments that create a range of new liminal situations, she explores the tension between technology and expression. Computers and new technologies may save us a lot of work \u2013 but to what end? Do they free us from arduous tasks to be more creative or do they force us to become ever more productive? What if machines make us obsolete? We eagerly plug into the networks that surround us, hardly aware of the profound changes taking place behind the screens, where the flow of data takes on a dynamic of its own. Wagenknecht points to the glitches in systems and networks that can suddenly manifest hitherto invisible borders. This can apply to technology or the internet but just as well to women's roles in society, refugees or larger cultural systems.

Using the story of a veteran's girlfriend who has mixed feelings when he returns, the interactive Web narrative quickly became an iconic work that inspired many artists to create their own interpretations of it. In the exhibition at MU thirteen interpretations will be shown, and two new commissioned works will be presented as homages to MBCBFTW, a tribute to a medium and a new approach to keeping history alive.Participating artistsInbal Shirin Anlen, Freya Birren (Jennifer Walshe), Vadim Epstein, Dragan Espenschied, JODI, Olia Lialina, Abe Linkoln, Guthrie Lonergan, Armin Medosch, Ignacio Nieto, Anna Russett, Tale of Tales a.k.a.

They explore its materiality, stimulation, quantification using technology, integration with alien matter, and, finally, its obsolescence by simulation. The artists here expand our collective knowledge of the body both by creating sensorial experiences for visitors and tapping into the hugely expanded science of the body through fields such as Microbiology, Neuroscience, Genomics, and tissue culturing. These and other areas of study now make it possible to enhance, protect, monitor, stimulate, and replicate functions of the body and behavior of human cells as never before. Such abilities pry open doors of possibility for creative expression and prompt artists to materialize how these changes transform our long-held notions of identity and imagine the future they foretell.The variety of media employed in the finished works includes theater performance, video, artificial intelligence, drones, cancerous cells, gut bacteria and pig hearts.Among the participants are the three winners of the Bio Art and Design Award for 2015: Isaac Mont\u00e9 with The Art of Deception, Agi Haines with Drones with Desires & Emma Dorothy Conley with MSA: Microbiome Security Agency. Sponsored by ZonMw and NWO, which grants 25.000 euros to each artist to work closely with a Dutch research institution and produce new work over the course of the year.?Participating artists are Maarten Vanden Eynde, Charlotte Jarvis, Floris Kaayk, Orion Maxted, Kirstin Neidlinger, \u0160pela Petric  and Hongjie Yang.

A Holon might best be described as a soap bubble you don't have to blow yourself. Razor-thin iridescent strips attached to a rotating axis create the illusion of a spherical form that breaks and disperses the surrounding light just like a soap bubble would: revealing all the colours of the rainbow. But where soap bubbles tend to burst after a brief flight, the Holons are driven by simple electro-motors that sustain them without effort. The moment of marvel seems to go on for ever as MU's exhibition space becomes submerged in the magic of these autonomous creatures.Discovered accidentally during experiments with reflecting materials, the Holons interweave a childlike fascination with aesthetic exaltation. Visit MU and get enchanted by their play of light and motion that celebrates life in a dance with the night.

        "en_page_text": "MU's space, centrally located at Srijp-S, will be the stage for a fresh design talkshow at the end of every Dutch Design Week-day. Everything concerning design could be point of discussion, it will be entertaining for a broad audience as well as the more developed designlover. The talkshow will place design in the center of actuality, will aim for a dialogue between makers, users and thinkers an will explore new journalistic pratice at the same time. For example: there will be experiments with Virtual Reality journalism, in cooperation with Design Academy Eindhoven (minor Crafting Narratives) and VPRO Medialab.Host of the evenings will be Isolde Hallersleben. The shows will be covered by our own cross media platform: Emma Radio.This talkshow is initiated by MU and Design Academy Eindhoven. Other partners are DDW, VPRO Medialab, Creative Industries Fund NL, Designhuis, MOTI and Balkan Laboratories.ProgrammeSun 18 Oct DESIGNING ALTERNATIVES Sustainable approachesThe government is highly committed to sustainable economic growth. But are growth and green compatible entities? How can designers contribute to a more circular economy focused on the maximum reuse of products? How do those missions combine green with sustainable economic design practice? What change is needed in thinking, planning and the economy to actually be able to achieve sustainable alternatives?With Anna Dekker (Studio KNOL), Maurizio Montalti (Officina Corpuscoli), Jalila Essa\u00efdi (Bio Art Laboratories), Cindy van den Bremen (curator de Circulaire Fabriek), Tom van Soest (Stonecycling), Nadine Sterk (Atelier NL, Earth Alchemy Factory), Alissa van Asseldonk & Renee Scheepers (Stroompunt), Anne van Strien (The Wise City) and others.Mon 19 Oct REVERSED MENTORING Future design educationIt will not be long before MOOCs and other online courses can be added to the CV. Knowledge and skills are not only gained in a classroom for quite some time now. Indeed the classrooms seem to be getting more of an exchange place where young people and their coaches and mentors (the word teacher is definitely passe) share ideas with each other.It is also called Flipping the classroom. During this session we will also flip the talkshow. We allow students to talk about the design education of the future. In the audience we welcome teachers and directors of the Design Academy Eindhoven, Artez, HKU, Willem de Kooning, SPARK entrepreneurs Academy and Academy Maastricht.With Tamar Shafrir (tutor Design Academy Eindhoven), Alvin Arthur (student Design Academy Eindhoven), Cassandra Vughts (SPARK academie), Robert de Vaan (CMD Avans), Caroline Hummels (TU/e, Industrial Design), Erwin Slegers (HKU) and others.Tue 20 Oct RESEARCH & SCIENCE Designers as lapdogs for scientists?Design and science know how to find each other more and more. The innovative and exploratory spirit of the designer seems to combine well with the more analytical approach of science. But how can designers call themselves real researchers? Are they taken seriously and do the developed design products and prototypes count, as well as academic papers as interesting bearers of knowledge? How do we prevent designers being the lapdogs of scientists? How do we ensure that the looking for solutions mentality of designers, doens't scare of scientists? In short, how do we prevent mediocre design and halfhearted science?With Koert van Mensvoort  (Ambassadeur DDW15, Next Nature NETWORK en Research Fellow TU/e), Bas Raijmakers (CRISP & Lectoraat Design Academy Eindhoven), Rob Zwijnenberg (Universiteit Leiden), Mike Thompson (Thought Collider, FATBERG & CRISP), Isaac Mont\u00e9 (winnaar BAD AWARD 2015) and others.Wed 21 Oct NURTURING COLLABORATIONS Balancing green & fair foodDevelopment organization HIVOS entered a long-term collaboration with Baltan Laboratories last year under the name Age of Wonderland, to explore how design, art and development can inspire each other. During Dutch Design Week a group of eight international artists are invited in Eindhoven to share their ideas about social innovation with the public. The focus is a reciprocal relationship; what can we learn from designers in developing countries to provide better help?With Arne Hendriks (curator Age of Wonderland, HIVOS/Baltan Laboratories), Ahadi Katera & Achmad Fadillah (ontwerpers Age of Wonderland), Pim van Baarsen (SuperLocal), Judith Zengers (ZLTO, Agri meets Design) and others.Thu 22 Oct HEALTHY URBAN LIVING Social design practicesWhat do we need to properly set up our future urban life? According to many forecasts the growth of cities will only proceed. This requires new ways of living, working and recreating together. What will the new work landscape look like? Are we going gather our income from changing networks, are we going to move more often, or not? How do leisure, work and recreation go together with the crowded cities?With Jorge Alves Lino (Designhuis),  Eline Hesse (Creactivism), Desiree van der Gracht (A Future Home), El\u00e9onore Delisse & Laura Ferriere (The White Building), Kristel Hermans (Talk to the Floor), David Hamers (Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving), Vivian van Gaal & Danny van der Laan (MU), Conor Trawinski (Uit de Buurtfabriek) and others.Fri 23 Oct CREATIVE CODING & CRYPTO DESIGN Shaping our digital livesMust a good designer be able to encode in the future? As more designes takes place on or behind the screen, that question is more pressing than ever. Interfaces, serious games, applications and websites require a robust design and it's a sector that will continue to grow in the coming years. Do designers have a real voice in this area or are they being overshadowed by the techies? How much power does the user have in the final product? The by MOTI developed Crypto Design Challenge goes one step further by also taking a closer look on the extremely complicated securing of text and image. In art schools most attention is focused towards developing artistic vision and visual style and technology is hardly an issue, while at the technical universities, the artistic and creative visual aspect remains underexposed. The Crypto Design Challenge will provide a bridge between the two worlds. Visual designers need to be involved at an early stage in the development of technology. In short: who will shape and secure our digital domain and what do we as an audience actually think is desirable?With Mieke Gerritzen (MOTI), Caroline Nevejan (TU Delft), Rosa Menkman (winnares Crypto Design Challenge), Jarl Schulp (Fiber & Coded Matters), Tijmen Schep (Set Up), Vivian van Gaal (MU, Coded Creatures & De Creatieve Code), Alain Dujardin (creatief directeur Greenberry), Bastiaan de Nennie (The Digital Virtuosity), Thomas Widdershoven (creatief directeur Design Academy Eindhoven, curator Thing Nothing), Bart Brouwers (E25), Koert van Mensvoort (Ambassador DDW15, Next Nature NETWORK and  Research Fellow TU/e) and others.Sat 24 Oct IMMERSIVE FUN Designing experienceThere is a great need for new stories in the new media landscape. New technologies such as immersive virtual reality and the gaming industry in theory have unprecedented opportunities, but the practice is still in its infancy. Together with students of the studio Crafting Narratives of Design Academy Eindhoven, the VPRO lab has started an investigation into these new ways of narrative through VR. What does the public experience? Can we tell them more empathic stories and does it increase the experiential aspect? To what extent can we use it in other contexts such as health care, science or politics?With Aldo Hoeben (fieldOfView), Steye Hallema (VPRO Medialab), studenten Crafting Narratives (DAE), Detlef La Grand (WOID), Mirjam van Dijk (VPRO Peepshow), Thierry Pul (Purple Pill) Allison Crank (The Reality Theatre), PieterJan Pieters (OWOW), Bart Brouwers (E52), Danielle Arets (Design Academy Eindhoven) and others.Where MUWhen 18 - 24 OctoberOpening hours every day from 17.30 - 19.30Free entranceView the videos of the talkshows right here!www.createoutloud.nlDuring the daytime visit: Collective [Ir]Rationality || Researching mass behaviour in MUImages: HeyHeydeHaas",

        "en_page_text": "Just Follow The Crowd! During Dutch Design Week 2015, hundreds of thousands of people visit Eindhoven to see the latest developments in design. They move from one location to the next in droves, they eat in restaurants created for the occasion and wait in line for the design rides. What is it that makes so many individuals, who are genuinely interested in originality and authenticity, all follow each other and tell each other where it's at and where it isn't and what they really shouldn't miss? Especially for MU, visited by over 36,000 people in nine days during last year's DDW, Studio KNOL will create a spatial installation to research this collective (ir)rationality.Studio KNOL specialises in constructing spatial narratives: for their conceptual designs they literally build parallel worlds to draw attention to current developments within society and to make them more tangible. Their installations are carefully designed research projects with a fictitious character, allowing ample room for alternative interpretations. In the past few years, they collaborated with MU several times.For Collective (Ir)rationalities, Studio KNOL will transform MU's space into a landscape where the rules of mass behaviour can be researched and experienced. The most striking thing about complex group behaviour is that it often comes about without overall co-ordination, simply because individual members of the crowd directly respond to those around them. The fantastic patterns of a flock of sparrows for instance or the incomprehensibly abrupt movements of a school of herring can be caught in three basic rules: follow the same direction, avoid collisions, stay together. But how these fish instantaneously know where the others are swimming and which way they turn, remains a mystery.And what about people? Do we consciously or unconsciously follow collective rules? Are we being guided by some 'invisible hand' like the one that, according to Adam Smith, brings together supply and demand? Is our behaviour influenced by the room we are in or doesn't it affect us at all? To what extend can our mass behaviour be traced back to individual decisions? In short: what moves us to collective (ir)rationality? So, for all those people who will be walking around at the DDW wondering where it's at: Studio KNOL at MU, Strijp-S.

Meanwhile, they reveal how fragmented and illusionary our 'normal' perception really is. The stable, solid view of reality we are so familiar with, is being broken down with casual ease and replaced by different ways of perceiving the world or ourselves.The projections that are being generated for, or rather with, the visitors of MU, will  immediately be recognised as artificial, technical or digital. De Nijs isn't striving for a convincing imitation of reality. He is well aware that only the abstract and intangible nature of the digitalised images allows for an immersive experience \u2013 and for the many divergent interpretations they elicit.De Nijs builds his installations like experimental setups in a laboratory where he is testing both the technology and its aesthetic, cinematographic and dramatic applicability. In the process, he hardly ever uses technologies that are readily available: it always comes down to experimenting, constructing, tinkering and programming. The expertise comes from all over the world: especially for the development of dedicated software, De Nijs collaborates with institutions like V2 in Rotterdam, the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of New South Wales in Sidney.All of De Nijs's works are interactive to a certain extent and the visitor often plays an important part in generating the image \u2013 or the sound. This can be a very physical and active contribution like in Run Motherfucker Run (2001/2004) or Exploded Views (2008) \u2013 installations that provide a thorough workout for people who accept the challenge the work has to offer \u2013 or a passive role instead, like in Physiognomic Scrutinizer (2008/2009), Mirror Piece (2010/2011) and 15 Minutes of Biometric Fame (2011) that scan the faces of the visitors and use the biometrical measurements to pair them with comparable faces from a database.The four monumental installations that are set up in MU have been carefully selected from the interactive oeuvre that De Nijs has been realising since 1998. These works not only function as interfaces between body and technology, they specifically suggest different, more fragmented kinds of perception. What do we see in a flash, in passing by, upon approach, from the corner of an eye? The images move towards us, we progress towards the images \u2013they always remain elusive. And in addition, the works are closely related in terms of location and trajectory \u2013 the track, the course, the path we follow.Opening July 31st, on show until September 20th 2015Check our MU Play&Learn educational program for this exhibition hereSide program6 September Hallo Cultuur! 13 September Frequentie Strijp-S [CANCELED]www.marnixdenijs.nl",

We just can't stop talking about it.\u00a8Even more, climatological changers like global warming, new iceages, extreme rainfall and other 'nature disasters' have been on many political as well as social agenda's for years now.\u00a8Obviously artists and designers aren't unaffected by a theme like this. From Berndnaut Smilde's artifical clouds to Alistair McClymont making a waterdrop float steady in space and Emily DiCarlo's sunsets in different timezones? \u00a8Weather or Not wants to highlight the creative potency of works with the most unpredictable of elements, inside as well as outside on the terrain of Strijp-S.\u00a8Including, throughout the year, a program filled with discussions, workshops, debates, experiments and idea exchange between climate experts, creatives and the audience. Weather or Not's goal is to to make climate change tangible in a playful manner and to let the audience be weatherforecasters of their own uncertain future.Project 1: Same Time, Always Behind by Emily DiCarlo (CAN) and Hanneke Wetzer (NL) 21 Jun - 31 AugIn this ongoing, performance-for-video series, Same Time, Always Behind highlights the potential of the performative gesture and its connective power between two individuals miles apart.  For each performance, DiCarlo collaborates with a participant living at least one time zone away to witness a sun set. Performed within the same 24HR duration of time, each participant films their respective time zone's sunset and writes about their subjective observations. The video footage and the written experiences are then edited and viewed together, resulting in a \"compounding of time\" as though the two individuals had been physically together, sharing in the same experience.Project 2: Dear Climate 3 Sept - 11 OctFive international artists (Marina Zurkow, Una Chaudhuri, Oliver Kellhammer, Fritz Ertl and Sarah Rothberg) began Dear Climate in 2012 by looking for a new way to talk about the weather. They wanted a different vocabulary: instead of crisis and catastrophe, they wanted the familiar and ordinary; instead of desperation and heroism, playfulness and friendliness. Instead of imagining mass movements or calling for community action, they were interested in finding a more personal relationship to climate change. Read more. Project 3: I Wish To Be Rain by Studio PSK (UK) 17 Oct - 25 OctOne of the only certainties in life is that of death. Yet it has been subject to far less technical and social (r)evolutions in comparison to all the other aspects of modern life. To challenge the public's perception of what it means to die in the 21st Century, London-based Studio PSK designed the project 'I Wish To Be Rain'.With 'I Wish To Be Rain' they link the scattering of ashes after a cremation to an increasing ability for humans to manipulate natural phenomena, whether it be floods, earthquakes or rain. The latter is done by dispersing either carbon or silver iodide particles within clouds, causing water vapour to condense around the particles and fall down as rain. But Studio PSK wondered if a person could also transform themselves literary into a natural spectacle? Can we be ambitious in our death as well, and return to the earth not as ashes but as rain?Project 4: Borealis by Chris Kabel (NL) 7 nov - decemberCurtains of light floating in dark skies. Polar skies, the lights of winter. Made from woven fabric with a special glow in the dark yarn and a new technique invented to create very fluent transitions between delicate gradients in fabric. Digitally produced patterns are converted into fabric keeping this subtle color transition fluent after the translation from one medium to the other. Every now and then the lights are briefly turned on to charge the glow in the dark yarn of the fabric. When the lights are turned off again the fabrics glow with a soft light in their pitch black surroundings. In the darkness the woven pattern floats in space. The famed ephemeral Northern lights have been transformed into a tangible experience. Developed in 2013 for the Fogo Island Inn, Fogo Island, Newfoundland, Canada. Development and production in collaboration with TextielLab in Tilburg, the Netherlands.Project 5: Weer anders by Mike Roelofs (NL) January 8th - February 7th, 2016The photographer Mike Roelofs from Eindhoven, visited Spain, Greenland, Ethiopia and Bangladesh to portray how landscapes change through climate change and how people interact with it. On show soon in the MU Weather or Not container.Project 6: Summon Wind, Call for Rain, Disperse Fog by Esther Kokmeijer   February 20 - March 20, 2016'Summon Wind, Call for Rain, Disperse Fog', is a series of installations by Esther Kokmeijer that are part of her ongoing research project Because we Meet. This trilogy, focusing on the human ambition to control nature and to collaborate with it, can be understood according to the three phases of water: ice, water and vapor.In MU's containers, Kokmeijer has captured natural phenomena such as fog and wind in sculptural installations. Enchantingly beautiful \u2013 but not just that: some installations also have practical purposes, such as helping to forecast the weather.Kokmeijer hopes to present the outcome of her entire study in 2018-2019, at various locations in a traveling exhibition. In the meantime, parts of her research will already come to life, not only to enchant the audience, but also to contribute to the research as a whole. Weather or Not #6: Summon Wind, Call for Rain, Disperse Fog, is one of these interim exhibitions offering a peek into the process.The installations presented in the MU containers at Strijp-S evolved during a research into weather modification projects in China, that was made possible by the Mondriaan Fund.There will be a special closing event during the Equinox on Sunday, March 20th.Weather or Not #7: Why tidy my exhibition space when the whole world is in a mess? by Sharon Houkema (NL)  March 31 - May 15, 2016\"Why tidy my exhibition space when the whole world is in a mess?\" asks artist Sharon Houkema and transforms the space into the untidy 'oikos' of an imaginary environmentally consciouss consumer. Reminiscent of a natural history diorama we see animals such as polar bears and whales on dishes, laundry and food packaging, with their Eco-certifications, logos and calls for action all equally competing for our attention. The 80's Greenpeace slogan of which the title is an adaptation brings into mind a child questioning the parent on why it should obey cleaning rules when grownups fail to take their responsibility in the world. While responsibility was placed mainly in the hands of the individual consumer, corporations were (and are still) left off the hook. The installation displays environmental history through everyday consumer articles from the previous decades up to the present moment in which climate change is rapidly unfolding.Weather or Not #8: Clouds from both sides by Karolina Sobecka (USA) 26 May - 25 Sept, 2016 Clouds are visible from two sides, looking up from the ground but also when looking down from the sky. The exhibition 'Clouds from both sides' by Polish artist Karolina Sobecka wil be the eighth and last Weather or Not exhibition at the MU container at Plug in City, Strijp-S. The exhibition wil ben on show starting Thursday May 26th. More info soon.When throughout the yearOpen Thursday & Friday 10.00 - 18.00h, Saturday 11.00 - 17.00h, Sunday 13.00 - 17.00hWhere Strijp-S, across Onder de Leidingstraat",

Titled Incendiary, this show explores Cassils's multidisciplinary practice, which crosses a spectrum of performance, sound, sculpture, photography and video. The show is anchored in Cassils's live durational works and the resulting performative objects, which melt, vibrate, flash and burn with visceral intensity.Opening night will feature a live performance of Becoming An Image. Here the artist and photographer are plunged into darkness. When the photographer uses his flash, a burst of temporary light allows the audience to see only suspended moments of the performance, much like a \u201clive\u201d photograph, burning this image into their retina.  A sculpture bearing the markings of this violent attack will be on display for the duration of the exhibition.

The final film makes the stunt's theatrics as visible as its ostensible risk. Using techniques borrowed from Hollywood stunts, Cassils experiences the very real human terror of being lit on fire.The suits Cassils wore during 'Inextinguishable Fire' - Photo by Hanneke WetzerAnother work in the exhibition is Cuts a Traditional Sculpture, a series of large-scale photographs documenting Cassils 23 weeks of muscle gain (paying direct homage to Eleanor Antin's famous body nullifying work Carving a Traditional Sculpture).Also on view is a video projection of Teresias, named after the prophet of Greek mythology who transformed into a woman for seven years. A fifteen-minute distillation of a four-hour performance is projected of the artist pressing themselves up behind a voluptuous male torso, sculpted from ice, which melts away. In this piece Cassils is not just burning away the mantel of Teresias, they are absorbing it as well.'Teresias' - Photo by Hanneke WetzerOpening 22 May, on show until 19 July.Sideprogramm20 May Design Debate on perfect humans with Cassils and Marli Huijer at Design Academy17 June Incendiary day, with panel and performance at MUwww.heathercassils.comCredits 'Inextinguishable Fire'Photo: Cassils and Robin Black.Image courtesy of Ronald Feldman Fine Arts",

The number says much about the reach of art in the internet age but it also testifies to the appeal of his work. With Soft Focus, from 13 March to 10 May, MU is showing specially developed new work, projected in a room furnished to draw attention to the soft side of technology.   Digital art is new, light, open, cheep and free. It is everything, always, everywhere. Rozendaal isn't burdened by history; he has no stress, no boss, no budget, no deadline, no fuzz. Put this way, it sounds wonderfully free of obligations but in the mean time his work can best be seen as a continuous and consistent research into the graphic and symbolic representation of reality. A process of simplification, stylisation and abstraction, of sensing for the essence of things, that shifts from paper to the computer screen in 2001. The screen has been his medium ever since, with all the qualities and shortcomings that come with it. He makes clean, apparently simple animations that seamlessly fit into the browser window at any screen size: through clever programming art work and website always coincide.   As relevant and smart as the websites may be in regard to the art trade and the rapidly developing technology, there is an entirely different reason why they are so popular and why Rozendaal (who was born in 1980) is considered to be a prominent artist at such an early age: his animations are really very good. They are complex ideas disguised as simple images that appeal to the most diverging human emotions and experiences. Life is portrayed as an endless play of repetition and variation, of rise and fall, of being on your way without arriving anywhere. What is being build up in one place is disappearing in another; things move forwards and backwards simultaneously.   The animations also have a life outside the screen: Rozendaal often works with the reflections of images in mirrors and other reflective materials on the wall or on the floor. In MU he will experiment for the first time with more diffuse surfaces like bird sand, ribbons and balloons. Projecting the websites on a web of various materials that visitors can wander around in produces a softer, more agile image.  Liberated from the screen the sites become light sources, fragmented impressions of an online world; the work more than ever an immersive visual experience.   Apart from his own work, Rozendaal invented the BYOB concept: Bring Your Own Beamer. Find a space, invite a lot of artists, ask them to bring their own projector and turn them on all at once. Since he organised the First BYOB event in 2010, in Berlin, it has been repeated hundreds of times in cities around the globe.   Still, Rozendaal is not only active as a visual artist. He also writes haiku, from which he composed a special book that will be available in a limited printed and signed edition during Soft Focus. It can also be order online as an (unsigned) print on demand. Like his visual art, they excel in clarity and profoundness.

These emerging fields are the source of daring experiments and thoughtful reflections about how aspects of culture, such as our concepts of identity, nature and environment are changing.  In Matter of Life, MU and guest curator William Myers present nine such research projects at the intersection of art, design and the life sciences. The participants include the three winners of the Bio Art and Design Award for 2014, as well as artists and designers at the forefront of this developing discipline that merges the techniques and intentions of laboratories and studios, echoing an earlier epoch in which the arts and sciences were more closely entwined but also looking to a future characterized by disruptive biotechnologies.   The exhibition offer views of a line of cells from the brain of a zebra finch, the proliferating cancer cells of an otherwise healthy artist and genetically modified blue carnations that are allowed to take part in evolution once again through a new form of bio-piracy. Visitors are witness to the creation of a real FATBERG, offered samples of barbecue sauce made from plants mutated by radiation and presented with sprays that allow them to delete or obfuscate their DNA traces at will.   With their curiosity, uninhibited creativity and critical reflection, artists Arne Hendriks & Mike Thompson, Jalila Essa\u00efdi, Charlotte Jarvis, the Center for Genomic Gastronomy, BCL and Heather Dewey-Hagborg are making bioart and design an exciting and timely form of the moment.   Among this group are participants and winners from the Designers and Artists 4 Genomics Award, the previous name for the Bio Art and Design Award. This award granted three teams \u20ac25.000 each to materialize their proposals in close collaboration with leading Dutch research centers. The results of these projects are being presented in MU as a part of Matter of Life. Studio PSK intervenes in evolution to create a new messenger pigeon with The Economics of Evolution: The Perfect Pigeon; with Fungi Mutarium, Julia Kaisinger and Katharina Unger give us edible fungi you can grow at home on toxic plastics; and with Naval Gazing, \u0160pela Petri\u00c4\u008d introduces new maritime habitons to the sea, where the cultures of people, plants, fish and crustaceans meet.   What connects the diverse and complex works being shown in MU is a sense of urgency. Each project invokes penetrating questions about who we are as humans, as living beings and where the developments in the life sciences are leading us.

These audiovisual light installations that alter space and sound are accompanied by the latest NONOTAK performance: LATE SPECULATION. All in a mix of electronic music and dynamic visuals.   NONOTAK is a collaboration of illustrator Noemi Schipfer and architect and musician Takami Nakamoto. The duo has been experimenting radically with space, light and sound since 2013. Looking at their work, your senses are likely to deceive you.   DAYDREAM V.4 is an audiovisual installation that causes spatial aberrations by manipulating factors like space, time, acceleration and transformation. The second installation, SILHOUETTES, constitutes a dialogue between space and light, turning dots into lines and twisting lines into arches. These installations are being developed especially for MU and STRP SCENE #3 and will be shown exclusively during Glow Next. In addition to the works that they create for STRP SCENE #3, NONOTAK will return to the Netherlands to fascinate the audience again during the STRP Biennial 2015.   NONOTAK has been commissioned by the Mapping Festival (Geneva), EM15 ELEKTRA / MUTEK (Montreal), la Nuit Blanche (Paris), Roppongi Art night (Tokyo), Axcess Art Gallery (New York), Stereolux (Nantes), Playgrounds Festival (Tilburg), Mirage Festival (Lyon), Vision'R, Insanitus Festival (Lithuania), FUZ Festival (Paris), Lunchmeat Festival (Praha), KIKK Festival (Belgium), Nokia by Lumia (Istanbul).

For Marcia Nolte, Stijn van der Vleuten and Bob Waardenburg \u2013 the three people behind We Make Carpets \u2013 anything from pasta to clothes pegs, candy bars and even plain A4's can become part of the ingenious aesthetic patterns they build up from the inside outwards. On their knees.   No-nonsense, hard-working but conceptual and saucy at that, they build bridges between design and art. Their approach could be considered as a form of contemporary archaeology because no matter how small and insignificant an object might be, once it has been spotted by We Make Carpets' mass-reproducing eyes, almost anything can develop into an appealing carpet. They know their historical carpet motives and the weaving tradition of Brabant but that is not where they find their inspiration. Not the Persian rug store but the forest, the Sligro or Zeeman count among their favourite hangouts.   And so, starting by the end of August, MU's Strijp S interior will exude the atmosphere of an oriental prayer room where a large part of the floor between the concrete pillars will be covered with nearly all 50 carpets that were made in the past five years. Given the vulnerability of the materials it is clearly out of the question that the audience would walk or kneel on them. A breeze of air, the slightest touch could disturb the pattern. But clever corridors and a special pulpit will offer an excellent view on all the works. This way, all kneeling will be left to the makers \u2013 as one can tell by the working clothes that they have been wearing for the last five years when they create their work.   We Make Carpets specifically approached MU for their anniversary exhibition because of several collaborations in the past. In the summer of 2010, for example, MU challenged them to realise their first large carpet in the open air at the Strijp S area in Eindhoven, during the Flux/S festival. This became Brick Carpet, a landscape of concrete tiles and paving bricks, that rippled whimsically at close range but turned the industrial surroundings into a Land of Lilliput when seen from afar. For months, this carpet remained square in the grass along the Torenallee, as if it had been blown away from a table in a pub, the pub that had disappeared with the labourers from the development area.    During the upcoming Dutch Design Week, on Friday 24 October, MU will celebrate We Make Carpets' fifth anniversary with the launch of their first book, developed in collaboration with the graphic designers of HeyHeydeHaas. It will showcase the result of five years of hard work laying the most diverse temporary carpets and will also contain the newest creations. Besides the book launch, for this occasion we will also present the specially developed Gravel Carpet in a celebratory fashion. This semi-permanent carpet will give the grass field beside MU an new dimension for the next half year.

Before MU was established in this old Philips factory, the space was used as a manufacturing facility for radio tubes and light bulbs. La Bolleur, as our finalist, takes the space back to its original purpose and sets up a new production line. This old factory mutates back to producing lighting before MU definitively turns off the lights.",

        "en_page_text": "MU | Strijp S  Art & Arcade   If you are a gaming addict and an art freak, MU is THE place to be for you this April and May. Art & Arcade, a collection of ten gaming classics that have been given an artistic overhaul, is coming straight to Eindhoven from the Haus f\u00fcr Elektronische K\u00fcnste in Basel where it premiered.   Arcade video machines never go out of style. In the 1970s the first entertainment arcades appeared, the so-called Penny Arcades. As their name implies, they would spring to life after insertion of a coin. For decades these arcade games flourished, and classic games were developed and marketed for them, such as Pong, Space Invaders, Mario Bros, Tron Pac-Man and Donkey Kong.   Having grown up with these games it was inevitable that these visual artists would start using the arcade games in their work. They are restructuring the video games, fitting them with new functions, creating fantasy worlds and experimenting with 8-bit aesthetics to transform the gaming culture into art.   MU | Strijp S will be transformed into a gaming arcade where you can indulge yourself with games such as Painstation, Pentapong, The Machine, Radical ATM Service, Tesla Arcade, Cage was a n00b and Racer.   Guest curator: Alain Bieber   Participating artists: //////////fur//// art entertainment interfaces | Canedo, Maingardt & Hartmann | Hussein Chalayan | Djeff | Iv\u00e1n Kozenitzky, Federico Lazcano | JODI | MOBILESKINO | Evan Roth | Haas, Wellershoff & Winter | Andreas Ullrich / C.Rockefeller Art Investment Group   What's more, to offer some opportunities for a magical escape amid all this artistically sound gaming mayhem, MU is also hosting an impressive four-part video installation and a series of graphic works by the Chinese artist Yang Yongliang, as well as an interactive installation by the young Dutch artist Bram Snijders/DEFRAME. Both create black-and-white worlds that explore the grey area between the old and the new, the real and the virtual.  Solo Yang Yongliang  Yang Yongliang (Shanghai, 1980) attempts to fuse traditional Chinese culture with contemporary digital techniques. He has developed a unique animated style of digital panorama collages in which China's fast-paced urban development blends with the tranquil scenery of traditional landscape paintings.   In his work the viewer encounters what at first sight looks like majestic black and white Chinese landscape painting. Looking closer, the observant onlooker will discover that the jagged surface of the rocky mountains is actually composed of densely-stacked concrete buildings. The result is a depiction in which nature that once served as a way for ancient poets to find inner peace is taken over by the realities of 21st century Chinese city life and its congestion, flashy billboards, and high rises.   At MU Yang Yongliang will show two recent video works and a new graphic collage. www.yangyongliang.com  Solo Bram Snijders/DEFRAME   To be Reproduced (after Magritte), 2014   'To be Reproduced' by the young Dutch artist Bram Snijders (1984) is an interactive video installation that revisits the classic 1937 painting 'Not to be Reproduced' by the Belgian surrealist painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte. The installation reflects on the pervasiveness of virtual spaces that have become an integral part of our daily social lives.   In To be Reproduced the viewer enters a hybrid space where the boundary between the physical and the virtual world becomes highly blurred. The viewer finds himself standing in reality but sees a kind of life-size digital shadow of himself in the virtual space before him. This digital reproduction of the viewer follows every movement precisely. But the mirror image also stays uncannily faceless because he is only seen from the back. It is as if he were moving a few feet in front of the viewer in a graphical point cloud. www.deframe.nl   Opening April 18, 8pm",

MUtate No. 3 KNOL | Out of Office   In April, we opened the ideal flexible workspace in MU | Witte Dame that suits the work ethic of the twenty-first century called Out of Office. Or so it seemed. In a month's time, KNOL ontwerp transformed this space from a place with swings, a cuddly office-rabbit and a workbed to dream away in, into a place with a tight grid of gray cubicle offices and strict rules.  The flex workers were unaware that they were part of this socio-architectural experiment that the hype surrounding the New Working denounces. From Out of Office, we went back to just Office and we wondered what really \"works\"?   OddOne made a video where you can see the transformation, and KNOL explains.

MUtate No.1 Willem Claassen  Red Road  Opening: Friday February 14, 8pm  Willem Claassen (1978) gets the ball rolling in February. Willem is known for his large-scale installations that often refer to games, roller coasters or give a twist to existing structures.

This is Notorious R&D.\" \u2014F.A.T. Lab   Celebrating more than five years of thug life, pop culture, and R&D, the renegade art organization known as the Free Art & Technology Lab, or F.A.T. Lab, is going GOLD. F.A.T. GOLD, that is. From November 15\u2013January 26, MU will present the acclaimed work of F.A.T. Lab. Curated by Lindsay Howard, the exhibition invites the public to experience and engage with the collective's groundbreaking projects.   F.A.T. GOLD Europe brings together an international group of twenty-five collaborators comprised of artists, hackers, engineers, musicians, and graffiti writers.  Many of the members will be in Eindhoven during the week of November 10, participating in panels, hackathons, and leading workshops at MU, Designhuis and Baltan Laboratories in Natlab.   The exhibition features significant works from 2007 to the present, including new projects to be launched on opening night. Showcasing a comprehensive selection of the group's diverse output, the exhibition includes video, software, net art, installation, and performance. F.A.T. Lab members will also be creating and hacking on new, cutting-edge projects to be added to the exhibition on the fly.        In recognition of the five-year anniversary, F.A.T. GOLD Europe will also launch a new book co-published by Link Editions and MU, edited by Domenico Quaranta and Geraldine Juarez, entitled F.A.T. MANUAL.  The instructional book features a selection of works from F.A.T. Lab's history, all of which encourage DIY entrepreneurship, open source, and activism.  Join us for the exhibition opening on November 15, which will include a brief presentation by the book's editors.   F.A.T. Lab members are Mike Baca, Aram Bartholl, Magnus Eriksson, Michael Frumin, Geraldine Ju\u00e1rez, KATSU, Tobias Leingruber, Greg Leuch, Golan Levin, Zach Lieberman, LM4K, Kyle McDonald, Jonah Peretti, Christopher \u201cmoot\u201d Poole, James Powderly, Evan Roth, Borna Sammak, Randy Sarafan, Becky Stern, Chris Sugrue, Addie Wagenknecht, Theo Watson, Jamie Wilkinson, Bennett Williamson, and Hennessy Youngman.  Lindsay Howard is a curator exploring how the Internet is shaping art and culture.  She is the Curatorial Director at 319 Scholes and former Curatorial Fellow at Eyebeam, the leading art and technology center in the United States, where she researched and first presented F.A.T. Gold in April 2013.  Her work uses experimental curatorial models to reflect what she sees as an essential shift in contemporary culture, specifically a growing interest in collaborative creativity, open source philosophy, and unlimited access to information.

        "en_page_text": "MU | Strijp S   The Italian born artist Quayola uses contemporary digital technology to tackle classic aesthetics and the universal rules for beauty and perfection. Until now he has mostly created his studies in the form of projections, installations, photography and multimedia adaptations.   However, for The Sculpture Factory, which he is developing especially for MU, he is entering the realm of sculpture. The basic material is provided by none other than his great example Michelangelo: the unfinished series of four 'Prigioni', or 'Captives', made between 1513\u2013 1534.   Quayola was introduced to these images when, as a boy, he visited the Academia in Florence with his mother. By using these sculptures specifically as his inspiration, he is paying homage to one of the greatest sculptors in art history. But what is even more important to him is his focus on the process in which the material is shaped. And he is showing all: his studio, his sources, the software he has developed himself and the creativity which allows something new to arise from a work of art that has been around for centuries. In this creative cycle, the hand of the master has been largely replaced by the computer. But the artist is still at the controls.   For Quayola, the subject of The Sculpture Factory is not the final sculpture, but the material. A material which is constantly mutating into endless geometrical shapes, to set eventually as a series of sculptures. From simplicity to complexity, from sharp to smooth, from abstract to figurative. The Sculpture Factory as a metaphor for the complexity of life.   Extra programme:  Coded Matter(s) #3: Transmaterials | Friday 10 January 20:00-23:00 h   During this evening program artists, designers and theorists explore how fabrication technologies, such as laser cutting and 3D printers, provide unprecedented possibilities to translate coded virtual forms and digital processes into physical materials.   Transmaterials is the third edition of FIBER's Coded Matter(s) series and will also be the closing event for The Sculpture Factory.

Transportation of information and ourselves, this ever moving social and physical network around us, is what fascinates artist and Lodown Magazine-editor-in-chief Thomas Marecki. Travel defines our reality, but we usually don't ask how it is laid out. Why are things running the way they are? Sure it works, but every presence has a million turning points. Sometimes they lead to dead-ends, sometimes to major breakthroughs.   With Garage Grit Marecki wants to change perception and direction. We derive from the past, but tell our own future. Science is fantasy and art is fiction. Information is for everybody, technology has potential beyond controlling our everyday lives and we all travel more than ever before.   Garage Grit presents several artist positions to vehicles and transportation, information and traffic, bricolage and self-induced technology. These positions become manifest in artefacts like car part sculptures and paintings, cut out Google maps, self-made rockets and a poetically recomposed driving game. These are all grouped around the centre piece: a self-made e-Lotus.   All works in Garage Grit document artistic activism against the odds, far forerunning industrial adaptation. Garage Grit wants to trigger the mainstream with grassroots craftsmanship. Of course the electrocar could already be the standard, but it isn't. Therefore Marecki takes us Back to the Future, surrounded by likeminded artists who are able to suspend the political and economic assumptions that chain us to our present states of travel.   At the finissage of Garage Grit on Saturday September 28 Lodown will launch its annual Art Issue. This time the theme is Vehicule.

        "en_page_text": "MU | Strijp S   The installations of Zoro Feigl (1983) seem to be alive. His materials danse and twist. Placed together in a space, the separate works become one: large and ponderous in places, nervous or gracious elsewhere.   Feigl's forms are constantly changing, sometimes slowly,sometimes quickly. The exhibition space becomes an enlarged microscope: single-cell creatures, primitive organisms are twisting, groaning and convulsing. Without beginning or end the objects seem to be locked into themselves. As a viewer you become entangled in their movements: they embrace and amaze, but sometimes also frighten you.   Everyone knows the image of a dog chasing its own tail. We see an animal endlessly turning round and round, but the animal itself sees something that draws it's full attention. Oops, got to chase it. But the tip of the tail vanishes as quickly as it comes closer.   Repetition and change are at the core of all the new works that Feigl is creating especially for his first large solo. Each of these is an attempt to make his favorite synthetic material come alive. It moves until a screw comes loose, a part wears out or something just breaks. This vulnerability of Feigl's 'beasts' is reminiscent of our own fragility and our longing to project life onto lifeless things.  But most of all his work just oozes the pleasure of movement. Endlessly captured, until something breaks.   In autumn MU will publish a special transmedial publication about Zoro Feigl's work in combination with his exhibition.

That was what curator Hans Ulrich Obrist and the artists Christian Boltanski and Bertrand Lavier talked about in a caf\u00e9 in Paris in 1993. Twenty years later the flexible and open ended practice of do it has spread all over the world in many different ways. do it is an exhibition in progress, made out of individual instructions by artists that can open possibilities for the interpretations and rephrasing of artworks in a totally free manner. It is important to bear in mind that do it is less concerned with copies, images, or reproductions of artworks, than with human interpretation. For do it no artworks are shipped, instead everyday actions and materials serve as the starting point for the artworks to be recreated at each 'performance site' according to written instructions. Each realization of do it occurs as an activity in time and space. No two interpretations of the same instructions are ever identical.  do it at MU is the first appearance of this longest running curatorial project in the Netherlands. The 20th anniversary of this landmark project, will present the largest selection of instructional works to date \u2013including 80 newly commissioned pieces from artists selected by Obrist and Independent Curators International. They are all brought together in the newly released publication: Hans Ulrich Obrist, do it: the compendium (ICI and DAP, May 2013). do it is a travelling exhibition conceived and curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, and organized by Independent Curators International (ICI), New York. The exhibition and the accompanying publication were made possible in part by grants from the Elizabeth Firestone Graham Foundation, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, and with the generous support from Project Perpetual and of ICI's International Forum and Board of Trustees.",

In the vanguard of music, sound artists are always exploring new ways of creating music. Often the search will not only lead them to the new sounds they set out to find, but also to some unique instruments. Instruments which, besides being functional, can also be seen as works of visual art in their own right. Especially when they combine the aesthetics of craftsmanship with the possibilities offered by the latest in technology.   Usually these works of art perform their humble services exclusively on the stage, where they can hardly be observed from up close. But in the exhibition SOUNDS LIKE ART the spotlight is not on the artists, but on the instruments they create. It has resulted in an exhibition in which we can hear and, most importantly, also see the unique interplay between form, material qualities, and technology of these new instruments.   The participating artists include the American Andy Cavatorta, who created a series of harps especially for Bj\u00f6rk, which are played using gravity, Dutch hardware hacker Gijs Gieskes who compiles the most extraordinary new synthesisers from existing electronics, and Eindhoven based musician/artist Tom Verbruggen, better known as TokTek, who creates some ingenious sound-producing sculptures.   From April 23 also the music cabinet Splendour Lender by Jelle Mastenbroek will be added to the exhibition.

His work is focused on the essential characteristics of sound, light and data. Ikeda has gained himself a reputation as one of the few international artists who works convincingly with both visual and sonic media. He elaborately orchestrates sound, visuals, materials, physical phenomena and mathematical notions into immersive live performances and installations.   After presentations in New York, Bogot\u00e1 and Montreal MU will show Ikeda's data.scan [n\u00ba1-9] for the first time in Europe, starting February 1. data.scan [n\u00ba1-9] is part of Ryoji Ikeda's ongoing datamatics project, which he began in 2006. In this project he explores the potential of perceiving the invisible multi-substance of data that permeates our world materialising pure data into image and sound in all manner of ways.    data.scan [n\u00ba1-9] is an audiovisual installation composed of a combination of pure mathematics and the ocean of data generated in this world. Every single pixel of the visual image is calculated on the basis of strict mathematical principles. Elaborately composed microscopic visualisations are shown on nine display columns, and are all accurately synchronised with the minimalist soundtrack. Visitors to the exhibition will experience the vast universe of data, while walking through the grid formation of the works.   The data.scan [n\u00ba1-9] presentation at MU is also meant as an upbeat for the premi\u00e8re of Ikeda's spectacular new immersive multimedia performance Superposition which can be seen on Friday, March 8, and Saturday, March 9 during, during the STRP Biennial at the Klokgebouw, Strijp S.

Based in Paris, the seven-members of Starship Pleix sometimes seems to be in orbit around the Earth in order to be able to observe and map it out even more clearly.  Because what on earth are all those creatures doing there? Human beings, animals, and everything in between. Everything is transforming, deforming or mutating. They are throwing themselves en masse into pleasure, but in all the hustle and bustle a wry feeling of loneliness and vulnerability still predominates. Come too close and everyone turns out be armed or harnessed to the teeth.  It is certainly not paradisiacal if you look at it through Pleix's eyes. But neither is it totally devoid of humour, melancholy and absurdity. Perhaps Paradise Pleix is first and foremost life as it is, and then a touch exaggerated in the digital overdrive.   The fact that their work links up with the theme of GLOW, in which the city shows its face, is an extra bonus. The first week of Paradise Pleix coincides with this imposing light-art event. And who would not want to be enlightened and enter paradise if it is on the way anyway....

Since his graduation from the Design Academy in 2007, designer Bart Hess has made a name for himself in the world of international fashion, art and design. He is known for his much acclaimed cooperation with Nick Knight, Nowness, Lucy McRae and Lady Gaga. In his many-sided practice, he succeeds in uniting fashion, textile, design, photography and animation. His projects radiate an atmosphere of unworldliness and futurism. By means of an often extremely labour-intensive, manual production process he changes relatively commonplace materials into new skins for the humans of the future.   On the eve of his move to London, Bart Hess has accepted MU's invitation to prepare a production line that will support him in the pre-manufacture of materials for some of his high-end clients. That, in this post-Fordian era so full of creative industries, this would be impossible without the obliging labour of many 'voluntary' hands, is an aspect which he cheerfully, although not without irony, brings up for discussion.  WANTED: 10,000 ENTHUSIASTIC WORKERS    During DDW 2012, Bart Hess will be looking for extra hands to bring his latest designs into being. Are you hardworking and amenable, then this could be the perfect job for you! As a process operator, you'll be working under the supervision of Bart Hess and his team on the realisation of a number of jobs. The core task is production in accordance with the specified requirements of quality and quantity. It is of paramount importance that corporate safety regulations and procedures are met at all times.  We conclude a week of hard work with a party on Sunday afternoon, October 28, from 4 pm onwards.

Liam has assembled a think tank of mad scientists, literary astronauts, digital poets, speculative gamers, mavericks, visionaries and luminaries to collectively author a proposal for a future city- an imaginary urbanism, the landscapes that surround it and the stories it contains.  On Saturday June 16 and Sunday June 17 the think tank will be coming together in physical space at MU but also in virtual space for a weekend of public presentations, discussions and workshops. Come behind the scenes as we open up the design process of the speculative city and expose the deliberations of the Under Tomorrows Sky think tank. See the work in progress and join us to debate the social, cultural, ethical and environmental consequences of emerging technologies.  At 8 pm on Saturday June 16th the members of the think tank will introduce themselves and present a series of wondrous visions of the future based on their own research or projects. On the following Sunday June 17 from 11am the group will get together for an open day of discussions, design workshops and live sketching as they begin to give shape to their city Under Tomorrows Sky.  Eavesdrop on the conversations, take part in the debates on what the future city may be and contribute to the discussions on why such speculations on tomorrow may be of critical importance for today.  Joining Liam Young live at MU will be science fiction author and futurist Bruce Sterling, comic author, novelist and screenwriter Warren Ellis, synthetic biologist Rachel Armstrong, journalist, author and editor of Arc, New Scientist's science fiction quarterly, Simon Ings and many more.   The exhibition Under Tomorrow's Sky will open on August 10 at MU. See www.undertomorrowssky.com and www.mu.nl for further updates.",

You can visit the website for more information (in Dutch) www.wild-c.nl   A place where the city takes on a hint of the countryside and the countryside a hint of the city, where culture and nature form a pact and where people like to stay a little longer. A lively cultural hotspot. Thanks to an accessible, exciting and diverse programme of art, design, music, performance, workshops and food, everyone can linger for as long as they want, for inspiration or for fun, for rest or for play.   While last year, Wild-S at Strijp-S linked up with the United Nations' International Year of Forests, this year we are linking up with the 'year of Historic Country Houses'. A country house is traditionally a place where townspeople escape from their urban environment and enjoy themselves. With Wild-C, MU proposes a 'new country escape for the 21st century'. From July 28 to October 28, 2012 MU will open this 'new country escape for the 21st century': Wild-C   Wild-C is being constructed on a deserted industrial site in Eindhoven: Sectie-C. Sectie-C can be found on the Daalakkersweg in the district of Tongelre in Eindhoven. The former Stork and ADL premises have been transformed into a breeding ground where young talents and established designers can come together. Part of this open-air area is being transformed into a lively venue where young and old can inhale both culture and nature. No country house or castle here, but rather, a playful, colourful site in an urban setting where a temporary injection of green gives expression to the future cultural ambitions of this urban area.   With Wild-C, MU takes the initiative in a special partnership with KOP Breda, Kunstpodium T (Tilburg), CBK 's-Hertogenbosch, and Landkunst (BKKC). In collaboration with these partners, eleven artists and designers have been invited to develop special projects that will transform this site into a new country escape. These projects will nourish the imagination and arouse curiosity about the potential that is typical of an urban development area.   The works that have been specially made for Wild-C are highly diverse and range from monumental sculptures to subtle poetic elements, and from guerrilla-like interventions to interactive moments. The participating artists include: Willem Claassen, Tim Hoefnagels, laBolleur, Angela de Weijer, Diego Sindbert, Florian de Visser, Sil Krol, Germen Zoer, Theodora Kotsi, Anita Hrnic and Paul Geelen.   The far-reaching cooperation of these five North Brabant art institutions guarantees this collaborative project being spread throughout the province of North Brabant. MU's cooperation with these four partners is not only about content, but, in these times of crisis, is also a chance to demonstrate the potential and capacity of collaboration within a Brabant-wide cultural network. Ensuring that the works travel to other new and historic (country) venues in this province will open up an inspiring web of possibilities.   Not only does Wild-C offer a special platform for Brabant's talented creative professionals, but also, there will be activities on site that aim to challenge amateurs and 'ordinary citizens' to express their views on 'new country escapes' and the relationship between culture and nature. These activities will take place from August 28, mainly during the weekends. On week days, Wild-C will also be open to groups and school classes. For young and old, culture buffs and nature lovers, local residents, inhabitants of Eindhoven and tourists, over the next few months there will be something for everyone to enjoy at Eindhoven's first new country escape: Wild-C.

        "en_page_text": "How do we hold on to our memories? In how far do memories make us who we are? But also, in how far do they actually distort what once was true? These are questions that are on everyone's minds now and then, even though in this era of social media, they have acquired a different dimension. It is scarcely imaginable now that this was totally different some ten to fifteen years ago. A diary, a sketchbook, what is the good of them now that there is Facebook? Fortunately some people still know how to turn the preservation of 'what is' and 'what was' into a fine art. Tim Enthoven is one such person.Tim Enthoven draws. Ever since his earliest childhood he has been drawing. His memories are couched in ink. Since he graduated with honours from the Eindhoven Design Academy in 2010, his draughtsmanship has been conquering the world, simply by registering it. Sometimes his subjects are common-or-garden objects that he commits to paper with acute precision, as in the case of his graduation project 'Binnenskamers' (Dutch for Indoors), the graphic novel he published last year; as also on the cover of The New York Times Magazine or in one of his many sketchbooks, such as the little one in which he draws a portrait of everyone he talks to for more than fifteen minutes. At other times he draws bizarre metamorphoses with a moustache growing to cover the entire body, or a small wooden robot dancing around.That Tim's present style fascinates a great many people is beyond dispute. But the piled-up boxes in a corner of his studio, in which he keeps his youth-in-drawings, are if anything even more fascinating. Not only do they tell us something about the development of his draughtsmanship, but also about his coming of age then and thereby also a little bit about now. At MU's special and insistent request, he has agreed, just this once, to carefully unpack his autobiography: as the curator of his own youth, he arranges the apparently randomly-chosen events from his past into a ready-made story. With The Tiny Tim, he shows us the traumas and talents of a future draughtsman in a cross-border story full of self-help tools, registered in boys' rooms and sailors' cabins.Also see: Book launch The Tiny Tim.

Liam has assembled a think tank of mad scientists, literary astronauts, digital poets, speculative gamers, mavericks, visionaries and luminaries to collectively author a proposal for a future city- an imaginary urbanism, the landscapes that surround it and the stories it contains.  On Saturday June 16 and Sunday June 17 the think tank will be coming together in physical space at MU but also in virtual space for a weekend of public presentations, discussions and workshops. Come behind the scenes as we open up the design process of the speculative city and expose the deliberations of the Under Tomorrows Sky think tank. See the work in progress and join us to debate the social, cultural, ethical and environmental consequences of emerging technologies.  At 8 pm on Saturday June 16th the members of the think tank will introduce themselves and present a series of wondrous visions of the future based on their own research or projects. On the following Sunday June 17 from 11am the group will get together for an open day of discussions, design workshops and live sketching as they begin to give shape to their city Under Tomorrows Sky.  Eavesdrop on the conversations, take part in the debates on what the future city may be and contribute to the discussions on why such speculations on tomorrow may be of critical importance for today.  Joining Liam Young live at MU will be science fiction author and futurist Bruce Sterling, comic author, novelist and screenwriter Warren Ellis, synthetic biologist Rachel Armstrong, journalist, author and editor of Arc, New Scientist's science fiction quarterly, Simon Ings and many more.   The exhibition Under Tomorrow's Sky will open on August 10 at MU. See www.undertomorrowssky.com and www.mu.nl for further updates.",

And where better to present these projects than the venue of the annual gathering of the world of design: the Salone di Mobile in Milan.   MU Goes Milan, taking along six different works by four designers/collectives. In the past two years, HeyHeyHey, Lucas Maassen, Studio Maarten Kolk & Guus Kusters and Raw Color developed works that were for the greater part commissioned by MU and could already be seen separately at MU, sometimes in a more extensive form.   HeyHeyHey recently developed a travel version of the legendary Melvin the Mixed Media Machine. This spectacular Rube Goldberg, with Twitter and Facebook account, already charmed some 14000 people at MU during the Dutch Design Week 2010 and then, registered on film, became an outright internet hit with 80000 fans. Melvin the Mini Machine is another Rube Goldberg, which consists of two old trunks jam-packed with various objects. All these objects work together to reach the same goal: the signing and preparing of a picture postcard for the mail.   Raw Color and Studio Maarten Kolk & Guus Kusters will present Temporary Trees, a series of six photos and a video out of which they made an evocative and far from static analysis of the essence of the phenomenon of tree. These Temporary Trees were commissioned by MU during the Year of Forests 2011. And in cooperation with Make A Forest, this work was exhibited in the temporary Wild-S pavilion at Strijp-S.   D/STRUCT by Raw Color and Lucas Maassen will also join the Milan party. This post-digital installation and website was developed in the context of the MU exhibition After the Bit Rush. D/STRUCT is an upload project in which common-or-garden plastic products are committed to the digital domain in the form of 3D scanned models. The products themselves are pulverised and packed in small bags. The models live on on the internet and can be printed again at any desired moment.   In Milan Lucas Maassen will also first present his Lucas Maassen & Sons Furniture Factory live to the audience. For this project he puts his three under-age sons to work. They paint the hand-made pieces of furniture for 1 Euro a piece and, in compliance with the law on working hours for children, work for no more than 3 hours a week. The 'speed' of the production process, the dimensions of the furniture and the young craftsmen therefore determine the end result and the typical LM&S aesthetic.   As their second contribution, Studio Maarten Kolk & Guus Kusters will present Waddenzee-Eb (Wadden Sea Low Tide). This work is part of a series that portrays this inland sea in the north of the Netherlands. Studio Maarten Kolk & Guus Kusters imitates the unique tide of this area by translating this into a production technique. At each low tide, large sandbanks and wetlands are uncovered, and the sea temporarily becomes land. Every time the tide brings in and takes out clay and sand, a new landscape seems to emerge. Studio Maarten Kolk & Guus Kusters made a mould for a plate and applied a layer of cobalt glazing to this. Every time clay is poured into the mould to make a plate, part of the glazing comes loose. In this way, not only are the plates already glazed in the mould, but their colour also becomes lighter and lighter. In Milan, a new series of plates will be shown accompanied by a film of the process.   As well as D/STRUCT and the Temporary Trees, Raw Color will also present a solo project: Liquid Palette (2010). A metal cabinet contains 130 jam jars filled with pure and mixed pigments derived from vegetables. This project is aimed at showing the liquid condition of colour before it becomes fixated on paper or textile. Transparency and volume are important elements.   In collaboration with the participating designers, MU has developed a new total presentation of the above-mentioned works, which will be exhibited in an industrial building of Ventura Lambrata.",

After the assaults on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, the American government asked a number of directors and scenario writers to join them in thinking about possible targets and ways in which terrorists might commit future attacks.  October 7th, 2001, Los Angeles, CA - The U.S. Department of Defense has invited top Hollywood screenwriters to form a think tank to predict future terrorist plots.

        "en_page_text": "The Tosso Variations   For his first solo exhibition, the Berlin-based artist/filmmaker/composer Gabriel Shalom presents a videomusical suite in five movements. 'Videomusic' is Shalom's self-invented term for his unorthodox compositions of both sound and images. Shalom's practice is equal parts avant-garde electronic music composition and hypercubist visual aesthetics.Taking a cue from Musique Concr\u00e8te, Shalom slices rhythms and melodies from raw video material, using a self-consciously limited range of processing and effects. Shalom manipulates a broad palette of electro-acoustic sounds into different compositions.   For 'The Tosso Variations' he has recorded several free improvisations by the Japanese musician Shingo Inao. Inao plays his Tosso, a six-stringed sensor instrument of his own design, which reminds of the cello. Inao knows how to play the instrument warmly and sensitively, but he can also make it growl and scream. Each improvisation is performed with Inao dressed in a different outfit. This series of pullovers are from 'The Story of Oswald 1848' \u2013 a collection created by fashion designer Nicole Roscher for her label Von Bardonitz.   Shalom transforms these improvisations into five audiovisual movements. In this exhibition, Shalom's five movements are presented as a multi-channel video installation. The distribution of the audiovisual content throughout the exhibition space expands our sense of the space in which the source material was recorded.   Shalom's suite combines influences of jazz, trip-hop, glitch, free improvisation and chamber music. Working through successive degrees of interpretation \u2013 which include detailed graphic notations of Inao's improvisations \u2013 Shalom's approach is both analytical and spontaneous.  Timeless   On the opening night of The Tosso Variations, MU will also present the premi\u00e8re of Timeless, a video essay / design fiction produced by KS12.   On Friday February 24 Gabriel Shalom will give a masterclass and we will organize a screening with Q&A around Timeless. read more   Opening Friday January 13 at 8 pm",

Our identity play would be considered schizophrenic in the last century. We have more friends than ever before yet know new frontiers of isolation. The quantification of our experience haunts us in the form of a persistent history. And we are distracted more than we ever knew possible. These circumstances are paradoxically a description of the near future and a diagnosis of the current state of affairs. The truly timeless is redefined \u2013 it has transcended that which is classic; it has become that which is never finished.\"   On the opening night of The Tosso Variations, MU will also present the premi\u00e8re of Timeless, a video essay / design fiction produced by KS12, a creative studio run by Shalom and Patrizia Kommerell. This work was commissioned by MU and was shot on location during STRP Festival 2011 and the Playful Post Digital Culture symposium at the Klokgebouw at Strijp-S.

Wild-S is a place to play and to be. You don't need to do anything there, but almost everything is allowed. The United Nations haven't declared 2011 the Year of the Forest for nothing.  Wild-S is is mixed forest, filled with natural and artificial trees. Both in as many sorts and sizes as possible.    The natural trees have been growing through this summer. The artificial trees will be added to the forest in the course of October. A tree of cabinets, a tyre tree, a PETbottle tree,  a knitted tree, a bucket tree: anything you think of can be turned into a tree. Everybody is invited to participate during one of the many workshop-Sunday-afternoons that will be organised by our forester Albert van Abbe.   More information can be found at www.wild-s.nl  Make a Forest  Trees that make a difference, that's what the global project Make a Forest (www.makeaforest.org) is all about. Many designers and artists from around the world, from Amsterdam to Seoul, and from Zagreb to Taipei, will all be making an artificial tree this year. Together all these artificial trees make a global forest that contributes to sustainable consciousness and creativity. Forests need our attention, especially in 2011 since it has been declared the Year of the Forest by the United Nations.   MU is one of the institutions that is taking part in Make a Forest. On invitation of MU   Eindhoven based designstudio's Raw Color and Maarten Kolk & Guus Kusters have also focused on trees. Especially for Make a Forest they developed a series of 'Temporary Trees', trees that sometimes only exist for a second, but nevertheless unmistakeable and convincingly belong to the category of 'artificial trees'. These 'Temporary Trees' will get a place of honour in the open MU-pavillion in the temporary MU-forest called Wild-S. During october we'll be planting existing and new artificial trees made by as many other makers, both prfessionals and amateurs, around the pavillion. As long as these are creative trees.

The digital revolution, the great Bit Rush, is over. The question whether something is analogue or digital does not matter anymore. Everything we do is infl uenced by digital technology. Just as air and water, the property of being digital is only noticed when it is not there, not when it is there.   However, the way in which this post-digital world is translating itself in our daily lives is not unequivocal; certainly not now that the digital is beginning to migrate from the screen to the real world of physical objects that surround us. To many of us, the digital may already have become as essential as breathing, but how this breathing takes shape in the post-digital world is still unclear.   How do you integrate the digital, the screen, the computer and the internet with the physical world? What role could designers play in this fi eld? MU, in collaboration with Lucas Maassen and Unfold, takes up the challenge with 'After the Bit Rush. Design in a Post Digital Age'.   Especially for this exhibition Russel Davies wrote an essay. Download  Playful Post Digital Culture  In cooperation with STRP Festival and TU/e Industrial Design department and in the context of this exhibition, MU is organizing a symposium to be held on Friday, November 25 in the Klokgebouw at Strijp\u2013S. The programme starts at 11 AM, admission 8 euros.   Keynote speakers: Bruce Sterling, Mary Flanagan, Russell Davies, Dries Verbruggen and Ben Schouten.     All lectures can be found on vimeo",

The Tower of Babel is one of the primordial metaphors of architecture, art and construction, as well as of the multiplication and confrontation of diverse languages and styles. The tower also symbolizes the ultimate hubris of human creation -- the ambition to build something larger than life itself.   With the round tower as a central element in mind, The Great Babylon Circus choreographs ambitious experimental artistic positions from around the globe with a joyful sense of the spectacular. MU becomes the arena in which visions of the world collide and melt together. In a collaborative effort, spatial installations and visuals from micro to macro-scale are presented, reaching out as a source of inspiration and an invitation to build on and on for creatives across all disciplines.   The list of participating artists includes Brazilian social and cultural collective Project Morrinho, Belgium-German art collective Speedism, Moroccan artist Mounir Fatmi, and London-based think tank Tomorrow's Thoughts Today. The collaboration of these four global creative practices in the arena of MU will unite around the mythic Tower of Babel theme, presenting us with new angles from which to view this legendary subject, and arguing for its social, political, and cultural relevance in today's world.",

Tickets 3 euro for sale on Thursday and Friday night at MU (from 20h).   The internet is the most influential experience and interface to have emerged over the past decade, having an unprecedented effect on society. The impact on our minds, modes of communication, creativity and even physiology is undeniable. A new wave of artists is emerging that is trying to make sense of our relationship to technology and the internet. The New Psychedelica, curated by Francesca Gavin, is the first exhibition that demonstrates how this work can be seen as a 21st century redefinition of psychedelic art.      Overload   The 15 international artists in this exhibition are bringing mostly new works together. All works depict the experience of an overload of information and an excess of imagery. Here video works, sculptures, photographs and digital collages reference video games and retro rave culture, cheap science and totemic tribalism, trash technology and shamanism. A number of works in the exhibition use found footage and dated digital effects, or methods which tweak and misuse technology to break down its structure. The aim is to create a sense of chaos and collapse, excess and avalanche. Together the pieces demonstrate the vitality of the internet as a focus for contemporary art.  Altered states   This new wave of psychedelica differs from the 1960s focus on perceptual distortion and cultural upheaval. Cosmic cinema, fantastical imagery and dream machines have transformed into YouTube videos, gif culture and sculptural works that play with modern altered states. This is an art practise filled with video clips, dated technology, code and disintegrating images. It veers from the anti-academic to the overtly geeky.   The New Psychedelica brings together sculptural and installation pieces by Harm van den Dorpel (NL), Jim Drain (US), Nik Kosmas and Daniel Keller (Aids-3D) (US), Sergio Recabarren (CL) and Ben Sansbury (UK), alongside video pieces by Antoine Catala (FR), Paul B Davis (US), E*rock (US), Carlos Lazslo (US), Rosa Menkman (NL), Brenna Murphy (US), Jimmy Joe Roche (US), Jeremy Shaw (CA), Yoshi Sodeoka (UK) and Daniel Swan (UK).  Francesca Gavin is a curator, art critic and editor based in London. She is the Visual Arts Editor of Dazed & Confused, the art editor of Twin and a Contributing Editor at AnOther magazine. She is the author of Street Renegades, Hell Bound: New Gothic Art and Creative Space, all published by Laurence King. Her fourth book 100 New Artists will be published in 2011. She writes for publications including Vogue, Art Review, Blueprint, Oyster, TimeOut, wallpaper*, The Guardian online, Contemporary, Elle and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8i-D. Gavin also has curated a number of exhibitions and is the curator of the Soho House collection.",

The laws and illusions of film, animation and the perception of reality form the basis of an unbound visual experiment, for which MU is happy to provide all the necessary space for the designer/artist/filmmaker Fons Schiedon. 'A Man with A Plan', the title of his first comprehensive solo exhibition in the Netherlands, can doubtless be interpreted ironically.   In his role as the man with a plan, Schiedon comments on a world view that is only partly shaped by reality. What is at least as important as reality is images and interpretations of reality, which \u2013 if possible \u2013 touch us even more deeply and surround us even more compellingly. Life built up out of storylines that we construct on the basis of storylines constructed by others.   Schiedon plays on the awareness that, more and more often, we experience 'film moments'. For this purpose, he brings together a number of ideas which, in his eyes, are \u201cbastard children springing from a wild, global new-media orgy\u201d with, of course, the words 'bastard children' being used caringly. What we experience every day is at least as much determined by our own thoughts and emotions as by films, video fragments, social networks, TV series, photos, books and magazines, advertisements, and people with similar media preferences to our own. In his expressive anecdotes with their light dose of revealing humour, Schiedon allows himself to be inspired just as easily by such contemporary art icons as Paul McCarthy and Bas Jan Ader as by the degenerated 'fake' rapper life of the actor Joaquin Phoenix and the movement studies of the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. To whose work he then gives a twist of his own.   Fons Schiedon previews the exhibition during MU & More, at MU on Thursday, January 27, from 8pm, at which time he not only reveals his sources of inspiration but also expresses his (dis)approval.",

In a workshop of an hourandahalf you will get introduced to the world of open source programming with Processing. There will also be a three hour workshop Arduino, in which you not only code your own software but also build a mini-computer that will respond to your software like a little robot or sensorbox.   Workshops with open registration are being given on Saturday December 11, 2010 and Saturday January 15, 2011 between 2 and 5 pm. There is only a limited amount of places available so be quick to register at mu@mu.nl or +31 (0)40-2961663. Costs are 7,50 \u20ac pp for Processing, 15 euro pp for Arduino (excl kit).       Making and using software can be experimental, humorous and aesthetically rich.  The international exhibition Funware deals with this Fun-factor in softwaredevelopment, and the many ways in which artists have run off with it in past and present. For this seventeen very diverse and mostly interactive projects, in which playing with software is the starting point, are being brought together in MU.   Funware proves that the world is partly run by freaks, and that even the most formal and logical domaines of human activity are drenched with humor and experimental fun. Software is one of the realms in which these kinds op practices of geeks and professionals, codeurs and artists meet. Funware offers us a playfull way to re-address software, as an invisible universal culture, in its aesthetics, history, and power.   A great example of the above mentioned is given by Satromizer sOS Jon Satrom and Ben Syverson (video).  FUNWARE CONFERENCE On saturday november 27 MU and Baltan Laboratories in collaboration with STRP Festival organise a Funware conference. Provocative views on humor, software, playing and art will be given by amongst others Olga Goriunova (RUS/UK), Wendy Chun (US), Matthew Fuller (UK) and Wilfried Hou Je bek (NL).

And to make it even more diffi cult he is also a Rube Goldberg or, if you like, a Pitagora Suicchi. It doesn't even matter much what you call him as long as you picture yourself a machine that is deliberately overconstructed in such a way that it carries out a very simple task in an extremely complicated manner, often in the form of a chain reaction.   Melvin is not a designmachine though. Instead of actually designing a product Melvin will just 'be', which makes him almost human. The makers, the designer duo HEYHEYHEY and their team of Mental Mechanical Masterminds, are after what they call the 'super moment' and the experience of it, rather than an end result. However, the machine will leave traces behind, things that are released during the process. And because this machine is, very 21st century, a 2.0 version, Melvin consists of not only a pile of mechanical bits and pieces but also various digital elements.   Melvin the Machine will be dozing quietly at MU throughout the Dutch Design Week 2010. Operated by a couple of laboratory assistants/professors, the machine will be made ready for use, with the process being restarted over and over again.   Super-super moment opening on Saturday October 23 between 3 and  5 pm. Melvin is on view daily form the 23rd till the 31st of october.  www.melvinthemachine.com  photo: HEYHEYHEY & Boudewijn Bollmann",

In August and September, MU will be placing its entire gallery at the disposal of the London artist/designer Stephen Smith, better known as Neasden Control Centre. Under the motto 'More with Less', a playful variation on the well-known modernistic principle of 'less is more', he will create an overwhelming visual world by which he aims to examine and lay bare the essence of our fully automated communication.       Those who, on the basis of this, are expecting an exhibition full of high-tech applications, will be disappointed. Smith mainly tackles things graphically. He is fascinated by old formats such as cassettes and film from a more analogue world, but also dissects digital applications and computers with equal interest. And yet, he is not as such motivated by nostalgia. First and foremost, Smith is keenly aware of the historical and all-embracing transition from analogue to digital, which we are in the middle of right now.   On the basis of this consciousness, he transports us into the ever more abstract reality of what communication means in the year 2010, and whatever preceded this. The whole promises to be a spatial collage with the characteristics of a rough draft, in which the visitor can stray through white noise, audiotape and everything in between.     More with Less, by Stephen Smith, also known as Neasden Control Centre, will be on show every day from August 21st to October 3rd, at MU, on the first floor of the Witte Dame building, Emmasingel 20, Eindhoven.  Monday to Friday 10.00-18.00 h., Saturday 11.00-17.00 h., Sunday 13.00-17.00 h.",

Works that, without exception and almost comprehensibly breathe urge and engagement. Works that also connect strongly to society.     Africa is, after all, the continent with the youngest population in the world. The generation of young artists now emerging in South-Africa and making a name for itself, is the first generation that has grown up and started it's own artpractice after apartheid. These artists are very aware of this, and are emphatically searching for their own way to express the political and social implications of this in their work. Some of them make bold political statements, sharp satire or choose for outspoken actvism. Others conciously keep far from politics, but in the polarised reality of South-Africa even that almost seems like a political choice.   Due to the Football World Cup, which will be held in South Africa around the same time, major brands such as Nike, Coca Cola and Sony have become an integral part of the South-African street scene. ...for those who live in it aims to provide an alternative, contrasting perspective, by showing us a broad palette of unorthodox, dynamic expressions at the interface of contemporary art and pop culture, particularly in Cape Town and Johannesburg.  ...for those who live in it is aimed at exploring, and showing in an experimental manner, the hugely variegated contemporaneous alternative culture of South Africa; from fashion, comics and electro in Cape Town to street art, performance and afro-punk kidz in Johannesburg.    Friday June 4:  Linked to the exhibition there will be a filmscreening on friday june 4 starting at 8pm in which amongst others the documentaries Biko's Children and Fokofpolisiekar will be on view.  Friday June 18:  On friday june 18 the internationally acclaimed South-African critic Sue Williamson, author of the recently published book South-African Art Now, will put ...for those who live in it in the broad context of contemporary art and popculture in South-Africa.",

        "en_page_text": "In the olden days \u2013 when people still thought the earth was flat \u2013 the universe was sometimes compared to the inside of a human skull. This was our notion of the infinite that lies beyond the world we live in, as a reflection of the infinity of our powers of thought and perception. This comparison, and, using the Hubble Space Telescope, the discovery of the most far-flung corners of the universe, are the basis of Ultra, Ultra Deep Fields, by the Brooklyn artist Maya Hayuk.  This exhibition, developed especially for MU, is this versatile artist's first major solo presentation in the Netherlands. She made a name for herself internationally with her spectacular murals, and her graphic art, performances and collaborative projects with, among others, the Barnstormers and bands such as Animal Collective, TV on the Radio, Devendra Banhart and The Beastie Boys.   Maya Hayuk, who has always been fascinated by planetariums and their way of literally bringing space closer to us, does not like to waste her time looking at nothing. This was also true of the astronomers who first dared to aim the Hubble telescope at areas in space that had thus far been known as empty white spots. They did not know whether they were going to see anything, but were convinced that there had to be something there. With the help of coloured filters \u2013 blue, green, red and almost infrared \u2013 they sure enough discovered that, what up until that moment had been regarded as absolute emptiness, actually contained the most distant galaxies ever perceived. For the first time in human history it was possible to depict the oldest galaxies that had come into existence during the so-called 'dark era', the time shortly after the Big Bang when the first celestial bodies began to heat up the cold, dark universe again. The resulting clouds of light were given the name Ultra Deep Fields.  Maya Hayuk's work, be it her large abstract murals or her smaller works on paper, is imbued with symmetry and colour. It is midway between the stellar clouds that the Hubble Telescope allowed us to see and the abstract patterns on Mexican blankets, Rorschach tests and holograms. Using a symbolism that also leaves room for spirituality, she expresses her love for what is positive and whole. For Hayuk, love eventually conquers evil, a motto that she also upholds as a member of the Positive Future Prophecy Posse.  With Ultra Ultra Deep Fields, Maya Hayuk builds on the installation commissioned by the 2009 Scope Art Fair, which she realised jointly with fellow artist Ben Wolf, and a recent exhibition at Gallery 16 in San Francisco.  Visitors to the Ultra, Ultra Deep Fields - Hayuk prefers to call them passengers \u2013 are given the chance to penetrate further and deeper into 'tangible spaces', thanks to the bright colours, video constructions, sounds and paintings that seem to go on for ever. A large 'planetarium' dominates the central area of MU as if it were half a disco ball or a head. It is surrounded by smaller satellites, each offering its own spatial experiences. Ben Wolf will mainly contribute light and shadow installations.  Maya Hayuk is represented by gallery A.L.I.C.E. of Brussels and Cinders Gallery of Brooklyn.",

        "en_page_text": "With effect from January 15th, MU and SubmarineChannel.com will be spotlighting the phenomenon of film titles. Title sequences can be engaging, funny, exhilarating - or simply drop-dead beautiful. Some ooze visual poetry and sophisticated imagery, while others hit you hard with their bold and audacious style. But let's face it, everyone loves a good title sequence.   A good film-title sequence means a great deal more than just the cast, the film crew and the title. Not only do they succeed in putting the audience in the right mood for the movie, but also transcend their proper function and venture off into the realms of something far deeper and far greater. They are the signifiers of contemporary pop culture and an art form in their own right.    Designing film-title sequences is therefore a fascinating interdisciplinary sector in which film, animation and graphic design come together. However, the designers usually remain anonymous. But there are exceptions. For Steven Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can', for example, the French duo Kuntzel & Deygas conceived a sensational opening sequence, in which they even managed to incorporate their own names. And Saul Bass, Kyle Cooper and Pablo Ferro are also heroes in film-buff circles.     As early as 2006, SubmarineChannel, the platform for digital image culture based in Amsterdam, launched the website watchthetitles.com. This site has been set up to compile the most interesting film-title sequences and to highlight designers. Reason enough for MU to join forces with SubmarineChannel in order to create this exhibition.  As well as the exhibition, which brings together more than 30 very different and more or less well-known creative film titles, MU and SubmarineChannel will also present a special evening programme on Friday, February 26th. During this programme, a number of film-title designers will discuss their specialisation and sources of inspiration. Everything it takes to make us forget about the film, if only for a moment. But most of all, to make sure that we will never watch titles in the same way again.",

Nimbly hopping between art, fashion and illustration, the English multi-disciplinary artist Julie Verhoeven (1969) has built up quite a reputation for herself over the past few years. Her work adorns fabrics from Versace and accessories from Mulberry. It makes reference to surrealism and Schiele, to name but a few influences. And although her surname perhaps suggests otherwise, Verhoeven is English in heart and soul, almost to the point of eccentricity. As from November 13th, Julie will be bending MU totally to her will, transforming De Witte Dame into a feminine cross between a latex cabinet of curiosities, a Victorian boudoir and a stencilled punk bunker.      The core of Verhoeven's work are her drawings. Not just sensual and beautiful, but also tragic femmes fatales populate her creative world. Some display a hint of Beardsley, while others have a blatant Vogue stare or a constructivist physique. Allusions tumble over one another, easy enough to find for those who care to look. Blaring pop music and fashion, paintings and interiors, hairstyles and films, anything can nourish Verhoeven in her search for inspiration.   Verhoeven likes her women to humorously meddle with the boundaries of aesthetics, because underneath, destruction grows rampant. With a mischievous pen and a lick of paint, she reveals the deeper layers in a raw manner, in the best traditions of punk.   On the occasion of the exhibition, MU will publish 'A Bit of Rough', a book dedicated to the work of Julie Verhoeven. This publication includes an essay by critic Francesca Gavin.",

        "en_page_text": "A project by Frank Bruggeman and Ernst van der Hoeven.   GroundAbout is about looking. It's about city and vegetation, culture and nature, not as separate entities but as one amalgamated whole. Artist Frank Bruggeman and Landscapearchitect Ernst van der Hoeven have a sharp eye for these kinds of places. Sometimes unspoiled green grows rampant, at other times buildings or other human traces dominate the image.   For GroundAbout at MU Bruggeman and Van der Hoeven, makers of the magazine Club Donny, are seeking tension between cultivated and 'wild' nature in and around Eindhoven. Twenty spots they found, with ease. No neatly raked-over parks or well-tended inner gardens, but community gardens, construction sites and traffic islands, unexpected oases full of botanical richness. A variegated privet run wild in a neglected citypark or a deserted switch yard taken over by nature. The prevailing question in all cases is to what these places owe their unique sensibility. What makes a patch of land a spot, a segment of city a biotope?   GroundAbout, however, aims to be more than just a special course in observation. It is the makers' ambition \u2013 quite in line with the objective of the magazine \u2013 to break a lance for the personal perception of nature in an urban context and the generous sharing of it.  Club Donny and GroundAbout both aim to show the audience more than the obligatory green of public gardens, parks, and avenues. Not that these aren't nice, quite the contrary. But there is more, much more that often legitimizes it's existence beyond the scope of the municipal regulations and doesn't reveal itself readily. It is located in the side wings of the city, the residual spaces, the twilight zones. Those who are receptive to it and 'discover' it, will experience it as a free state. A free and very individual experience.   The fragmented urban structure of Eindhoven proves to be an ideal landscape for research into these uniquecityscapes. GroundAbout depicts twenty of them. Printed in poster format, they are ready to be taken home with you. Together with crude wooden structures they form an installation with which MU temporarily goes beyond the nature of an exhibition space. If you climb the bridge and lookouts, you will experience this art biotope in the city in a very different way, if only for a brief moment. Even the view of the 'concrete' reality of its environment takes on a different perspective.   In collaboration with Eric Roelen (installation) and Boudewijn Bollmann (photography)  At the invitation of MU, Bruggeman and Van der Hoeven also designed a special area at Strijp S: an elongated labyrinth with a huge diversity of dahliaspecies in funky flowerbeds immediately next to the NatLab. This Dahlia Drive is part of the flux-s festival, which takes place from September 10 through September 13. Dahlia Drive is also made possible by Woonbedrijf.  Club Donny",

A psychedelic print with sound effects, an analogue TV animation, a carrousel full of images, an architectural dream, typographical reflections and a painted-over short-fronted farmhouse. A random sample of what will be on view this summer during the exhibition HIER&DAAR.  At the invitation of MU and KOP, 20 promising artists and designers from Breda and Eindhoven, all born after 1970, show new work in two groups both in Eindhoven and in Breda. Brabant-wide, so to say.   There is between MU and KOP a feeling of kinship that expresses itself in the hybrid way in which they perceive the art world. The motto is: quality in imagination, diversity in media and disciplines, and an open collaboration with promising young artists. There is absolutely no curatorial straitjacket. HIER&DAAR encourages artists to achieve on a modest working budget a professional presentation in the two most exciting art spaces of Brabant.    HIER&DAAR also represents the first step of two medium-sized art institutes in making an initial open-collaboration contribution to the Brabant ambitions to become Cultural Capital of Europe in 2018. In the coming years, it will be easy for other parties from the various BrabantSteden (BrabantCities) to link up with this initiative and in a few triple jumps present a sample of the rich cultural humus of the provinces in the Southern Netherlands.     The artists whose new work is first shown in MU are:  Sven Fritz  Ajla Steinvag  Studio Smack  Evelien Lohbeck  Rop van Mierlo  Michiel van der Zanden  Marjolijn de Wit  Joost Krijnen  Gijs Gieskes  Lilia Scheerder   The artists whose new work is first shown in KOP are:  Staynice  Tijs Rooijakkers  Danny Scholtze  Willem Claassen  Liesbeth Verhoeven  Erik Vermeulen  Renee van Trier  Antoine Stemerding  Timon van der Hijden  Tom Verbruggen   Hier&Daar/Here&There  Jonge kunst uit Brabant / Young Art from Brabant  25/06 \u2013 23/08  MU, Eindhoven  KOP, Breda   Opening Part 1:  KOP, Breda  Thursday 25/06 08.00 pm   MU, Eindhoven  Friday 26/06 08.00 pm   Part 1 runs through Sunday 19 July; after that the groups change location.

        "en_page_text": "What are we looking at when we're looking at something and how precisely are we looking at it? And is our way of looking perhaps just as personal as our handwriting? These questions have intrigued designer Christien Meinderstma (1980) for some time now, reason why she eagerly accepted MU's invitation to delve deeper into the matter.   \u201cIt would be fascinating, wouldn't it, if it turns out that we all look at the same things in a slightly different way, if a designer looks at things differently than a bicycle mender or a judge does, and a seven-year-old differently again than a seventy-year-old, just to mention a few examples.\u201d     To investigate this issue, Meindertsma will establish a viewing laboratory in MU in De Witte Dame between May 1 and June 14. Built on an older experiment that she and Joris Laarman carried out some time ago in the Textielmuseum, this viewing laboratory will register every visitor's way of looking by means of eye-trackers and reproduce the result on the spot.   How do you look, for example, at a cup or a slice of bread, a bicycle or a sowingmachine? The eye-tracker follows the movements of your eyes, while a large drawing robot with a thick marker attached to the other end reproduces the viewing pattern of your eyes on paper. The same question applies to looking at your own reflection; are you looking at your eyes, your nose, your mouth, or the shape of your head? The eye-tracker registers it accurately and, linked to a printer, print out your self-portrait on the spot. The aim is to have accumulated several hundreds of eye-drawn portraits and objects at the end of the trajectory.        To Meindertsma, this collection is in turn a source of inspiration for further investigation. Not the kind of investigation that a marketeer or a scientist would conduct, but a designer's kind of investigation. And it goes without saying that, if they wish, visitors can take their drawings home with them.      Although technical and experimental by design, 'Spectators' is completely in line with the oeuvre that Meindertsma has built up since her graduation from Design Academy Eindhoven in 2003. Time and again she succeeds in surprising the audience with profound and creative research resulting in intriguing visual reports that win world-wide admiration. Her graduation project Checked Bagage/Baggage is included in the collections of the MOMA, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and Caldic. And last year, she won with her book PIG 05049 the Golden Eye Dutch Design Award as well as the Rado Young Designer of the Year Award.   The Spectators Viewing Laboratory is made possible by Tobii eye-trackers and Buhrmann Ubbens      On Thursday evening may 28 form 9 pm onwards, the exhibition hosts the cultural talk & walk show Pols Hoogte hosted by Andrea van Pol. Christien Meindertsma will be present to elaborate on her project.            On sunday june 14, the last day of the exhibition we close the project with a special afternoon in which experts from different fields will dig deeper into the resuts of Makers & Spectators. This afternoon starts at 3 pm and is free of admission.            Christien Meindertsma at Omroep Brabant",

        "en_page_text": "A retrospective of the Austrian meidart duo Granular Synthesis wouldn't be complete without the singele screens works they have made next to their big multiscreen installations. In the nineties they became famous for their big works that overhwelm with their size and sensory experience. The single screen works are much more modest. They zoom in on one person, a color, a rhythm or movement and work best in an almost museumlike space. MU offers such a space and that is why we work together with STRP Festival and 5MinuteMuseum to make the Granular Synthesis retrospective possible.    The five selected films are closely connected. Starting point is WE WANT GOD NOW made in 1995, a registration of the movements of dancer Michael Ashcroft. This work has since then been reworked and re-edited many times into other films like FORM and SINKEN. This last film is a composition of 22 minutes for strings and audiovisuals in slow motion.  Besides these three films mentioned LUX will also be on view. This work reflects on the theme of 'Technology as our second nature'. Image and sound melt together to form one esthetic experience. As soon as something changes in the light or color of the image the sound also modulates and vice versa. The film becomes a unified field that feels like an endless continuum.  Fifth and last work in this looping single screen program is SWEET HEART in which the head of Japanese performer Akemi Takeya moves like you seldom see a head move.

The continuity of this practice (started in April 2006) led to an invitation to curate an exhibition for MU.   There surely is a difference in selecting works for MU compared to our daily internet activity but we define both as curatorial practices. This needs to be emphasised as we consider the work shown online as an authentic experience, not documentation. Redefining documentation as an alternative reality opens up space for equally authentic variations. According to Jean Baudrillard \u201cthe work of art is not threatened by its double\u201d. Bootlegs and interpretations should consequently accelerate the circulation of ideas.   Some of our favourite works have only been described to us, unsurprisingly as the majority of our art experiences have been mediated in one form or other. The majority of works presented in this show have been selected through written commentaries, verbal descriptions and jpegs found online. In fact most of the works presented at MU are the type of manifestations mentioned above: stories, descriptions, translations and interpretations, all understood as primary experiences.   The title is lifted from a short story by Henry James portraying a painter struggling with the dichotomy of appearance and reality:    \u201cCombined with this was another perversity \u2013 an innate preference for the represented subject over the real one: the defect of the real one was so apt to be a lack of representation. I like things that appeared; then one was sure. Whether they were or not was a subordinate and almost always a profitless question.\u201dHenry James, The Real Thing, 1892   If art and aesthetics are primarily perception as Paul Virilio claims, defining the authenticity of an experience should be left to the recipient, not the creator.

Each world refers to one of the many attention-arousing performances with which he over the past couple of years has presented his collections in Paris and in other cities all over the world.  Usually, Vibskov's surreal dream worlds are only inhabited by models wearing his creations. Lying down among hundreds of breasts on sticks, wandering across the black carrot fields, or music-cycling in the Fantabulous Bicycle Music Factory. At MU, however, it's the audience that are given the chance to lose themselves in Vibskov's universe entitled The Visit.    In his work as a designer, Vibskov succeeds in sketching unusual perspectives and creating surprising combinations of traditional patterns and techniques without ever causing the end result to lose its aura of contemporariness. He creates worlds that have a magical attractiveness, sometimes retro, sometimes futuristic, but always imbued with an intense colourfulness. The same holds for his free work such as the continually growing series of Fringe projects, in which he and his old St. Martin's schoolmate Andreas Emenius are investigating illusion, surface, and movement.    As a fashion designer, Henrik Vibskov has since his graduation from St. Martin's in 2001 developed 14 collections. Currently, he is the only Scandinavian designer who always presents a collection in the Paris fashion week for men's wear. Apart from designing two collections per year and creating the bizarre worlds in which these collections are shown, Henrik also devotes himself to drumming. He is the permanent drummer of the electronic minimal giant Trentem\u00f8ller, with whom het tours the world. Vibskov's work was also on view in PS1 \u2013 MoMA in New York, Palais de Tokyo in Paris, ICA in London, and various other places.",

'The Times they are The Changes', to paraphrase Bob Dylan, and so music leaves the field for image, film and \u2013 yes, a bit of \u2013 sound. After gigs in Milan, Tokyo, and Los Angeles, The Changes are now ready for a European tour, which kicks off at MU. Their overpowering image concert promises to be a mixture between a psychedelic campfire and a mysterious advertising pillar.   Departing from backgrounds in fashion, graphic design, pop, and art, the four band members have for a couple of years now applied themselves with sincere commitment and boundless passion for association to the magic of the autodidactic underground. In their interventions, the  influence of and the experience with the CULTural explosions of the '80s and '90s - rave, metal, acid, punk, freak-out, rainbow, black, silver, gold, latex, leather, and denim - merge into a redefinition of the present, a joyful, comic explosion, pulsating with energy and positivism.   The Changes are Roland Korg, Boohoo Haha, Aries Overload, and Vertical Doorway. To those who don't know these names as yet, I'd say, think of Misha Hollenbach and Shauna T, better known as Perks & Mini from Melbourne, Fergus Purcell from London, better known as Fergadelic, and Sk8thing from Tokyo. The exhibition is accompanied by a special catalogue published in collaboration with Nieves and PAM Books, and a unique edition of T-shirts   The Times They Are The Changes opens on Friday October 31, 20.00h at MU.   Our special guest for the evening would be DJ Thomas Bullock, together with The Changes they will play live. Dresscode: Halloween.",

XX stands for 2 or 20, and that's what MU is all about this year. Because 2 is twice 1, and even more than that.   To illustrate this vision, MU, Thijs Bakker and Annemarie Klijn invited this year ten duos who have proved themselves in the design profession. Some are family, others friends or partners. Some work together harmoniously; others create their best work in constant conflict, and still others join forces only occasionally.

Discipline, in the English pronunciation. Sounds good, multi-interpretable, but is too close to a project in Hamburg, a couple of years ago. Streetart, no way. Better avoid the G-word as well, even when it is preceded by post.  It never ceases to amaze me, a relative outsider without any marker or spray can smudges on my roots, but with a passion for subversive art in the street, how much the use of the right terminology matters in circles of raiding artists. Sometimes I am surprised about the strictness with which the distinctions are made; at other times, I do understand the sensitivities and appreciate the seriousness with which the words and the things are assigned a place. A place of their own most of all, away from commerce and the art circuit, away from interferers and wannabees, always engaged in serious mutual debate and in an ongoing fight for freedom and self-determination.     It is in fact this ongoing fight and debate, this combat around words and territories that guest curators Jeroen Jongeleen and Erosie have tried to bring together under the name of Fundamentals. They are presenting here eleven elusive artist practices that have been active without any borders for years. Let one thing be clear, though, Fundamentals is not a marked-out project. It is about the exterior as well as the interior, about autonomy and circuit, art space and street, and the undeniable tension between these elements.   MU gladly offers them the chance to make all this happen. Not because Streetart is hip or because it scores easily. There are enough examples of this to be found in our country and in the rest of the world. No, it is because the artists assembled in Fundamentals - just for this single occasion \u2013 manage to dance ahead of the machinations of the all-devouring pull of underground culture. Because they are too fast, or to monomaniacal, too stubborn, or above all, just too smart. They value their freedom over worldwide fame and acclaim.

Constructed on the site, this rough, wooden construction will be the crowd puller on the Lichtplein behind De Witte Dame during the Eindhoven Summer of the Bicycle.   Anders Jackobson, born in Canada, studied at the Konstfack College University of Arts Crafts and Design in Stockholm. Contrary to the Netherlands, North Shore mountain biking is very hot in Canada, which is only understandable as the mountainous area with its forests and rock masses is considerable more rugged than the flat Dutch landscape. Confronted with areas that are too rough to cross over or through, the mountain bikers don't hesitate to build ramps and bridges of rough wood to get access to the area.   Lagombra (which in Swedish means 'good enough') built the first North Shore bike track illegally in the woods behind his house. In 2004, the Riksutstillinger Institute in Norway invited him to build a bike track on a large square in Oslo.   In Eindhoven, Lagombra's starting point was for a change not the natural but the urban jungle, reason why he built his bike track on the Lichtplein among the former Philips buildings. And because sawed-down trees in the centre of a city will be missed more sorely than in the Swedish woods, the track was built of rough scaffolding material, which adds a new dimension to Lagombra's work.   The bike track is still on view up to and including July 27. We hereby challenge experienced mountain bikers and BMXers to come and master the track. Mind you, at your own risk, and as long as you're wearing a helmet.",

Dick takes control of your mind, if time stands still, if ordinary things become mysterious and fantasy creatures overturn the order of your soul. Come and see works of ours being vandalized by other works of ours, a young girl peeping through a hole and Mickey Mouse going through ups and downs. I can't explain.   They call themselves restless European con artists. In art circles they are called the 'Bonnie and Clyde' of contemporary art. Born in Italy in 1976, Eva + Franco Mattes a.k.a. 0100101110101101.org have been besieging the art world with their clever hacks and elusive digital role-plays for more than ten years. Their current names, by the way, are pseudonyms as well: it's their way of taking a stand against the personality cult in art. Over and over again, the duo succeed in devising projects that subvert conventions, in art and far beyond. They hijacked the Vatican website, made everyone believe that the Karlsplatz in Vienna had been taken over by the swoosh, and baptised it Nikeplatz, and spread a computer virus at the Venice Biennale.   'It's always six o'clock', a work they have made especially for MU, is the next step in their artistic career. The work combines their recent plunge into the virtual identity factory Second Life with a surreal view on designer toys as well as 21st century sculpture. That they're excessively interested in Second Life, where no-one is what he/she really is, is beyond dispute. However, while everyone in Second Life creates avatars looking like eccentric or slick self-portraits, Eva + Franco's avatars are represented in an almost true-to-life manner. Subsequently, they mix the ancient rules of portraiture with Warhol's sexy Pop Art codes to form a cloyingly sweet and at the same time grating kind of 'second art'. Their avatars also re-enact notorious performances. Not because they like them so much, but to lay bare the differences between the real and the synthetic world of art.    In 'It's always six o'clock', the avatar portraits in their series 'Annoying Japanese Child Dinosaur' are attacked by an army of toys, not the digital representations but the real McCoy this time. From Manga characters to G.I. Joe, and from medieval knights to Winnie the Pooh, they're all performing in the theatre of pop culture. Cute yet ruthlessly aggressive at times, they're taking over the exhibition space. In the process, fantasy and collective imagination are fusing into a dramatically charged form of 21st ready-made sculpture.",

        "en_page_text": "From the dark depths in the texts of Morrissey, which according to the Norwegian artist Lars Laumann (1977) seem to predict the death of Princess Diana, to a literally glaringly pink collection of fanfantasies about Kylie Minogue by Australian artist Kathy Temin (1968). And from the re-enactment of a make-up session of glam rockers Kiss by Iain Forsyth (1972) and Jane Pollard (1973), stylised after the model of Bruce Naumans 'Art Make-up', to a subversive black-and-white portrait of Michael Jackson by Scanner (1964). Popshop, remixing icons of mass culture is a group exhibition staged by MU, in which artists are rehauling pop stars, fans, and world hits. This time, it's not about artists switching over to making clips, or to designing an LP sleeve, but clips being sucked back into the realm of contemporary art.   In Popshop, seven international artists present pieces in which the mechanisms of commercial pop culture are successfully dissected to the bone and reshaped. Sometimes, no more than 16 seconds of a clip suffice to create a nerve-racking image. Cory Arcangel's (1973) two-channel video Sweet 16 is such an image. By putting the two intros of the ten-year-old Guns 'n Roses clip classic Sweet Child O'Mine together, Arcangel creates a piece vaguely reminiscent of Warhol's Chelsea Girls. But while Slash starts in perfect sync, Arcangel, inspired by minimal composer Steve Reich's concept of 'phasing', takes out one note in the right loop, causing one clip to slowly move ahead of the other until it becomes out of and after seventeen minutes back in phase with the other and start again.   Filmmaker Ho Tzu Nyen (1976) appropriated Queens Bohemian Rhapsody in a quite different way. Set in the post-colonial Supreme Court of Singapore, the clip is a real courtroom drama full of references to the grim reality \u2013 the harsh justice system in Singapore regularly sentences people to death \u2013 but also to art. The accused, for instance, is wearing an Guantamo-orange overall, and while pronouncing sentence, the judge turns into a cardinal out of Velazquez' pope portraits or even into a Bacon. The filmmaker calls his approach 'mental karaoke', because the spectators experience their own associations with the lyrics and music along with the filmmaker's version. A process befitting world hits.   While Arcangel focuses on image and sound, and Ho Tzu Nyen on a particularly strong visual presentation, Australian artist Philip Brophy (1959) leaves the image for what it is. He simply uses complete eighties video clips by Elton John, Phil Collins, Billy Joel, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and Gloria Estefan, leaves the image intact, but completely erases and refashions the audio track of music. Brophy calls this Evaporated Music, i.e. an approach in which the sound that we so easily tend to link to moving images seems to evaporate. What remains is, says Brophy, 'a glittering and growling in the arena of the sexes that pop music is'.",

        "en_page_text": "Genevi\u00e8ve Gauckler designs characters. They look deceptively simple. Despite this simpleness \u2013 the design often consists of just a 'vaguely human or potato-shape form, with two eyes, ears, arms and legs' \u2013 so, despite this simpleness (and perhaps precisely because of it), her characters are extremely appealing.    This simpleness is deceptive indeed, for what do you actually see when you look at little colourful figures wearing oversized shoes and undersized hats? Figures that smoke pipes, and hold iPods. That get sick. Stare into space. Cheer at the sight of each other's excrements. Are feeling hungry. Are looking for food. Are feeling bored. Tired. Don't fancy a thing. Find humans a delicacy, especially the lips and the cheeks. Struggle with gastrointestinal disorders. What exactly are those Barbapapas-for-adults?  Welcome to the universe of Genevi\u00e8ve Gauckler. A world in which life is so delightfully simple because it revolves mainly around two things: to eat and be eaten.   Food Chain  When asked 'why food?' Genevi\u00e8ve Gauckler replies that food is both 'superscary' and perfectly normal. Food is everybody's concern, whether you like it or not. Food is ambiguous, it is good and bad at the same time, or rather: it is. Food has to do with pleasure, disgust, disease, surplus, consumption, survival, energy, digestion, cyclical processes, cannibalism, decay, stench, body odour, obesity, superstition, religion, affluence, fertility. \u201cWe're just a digestive tract,\u201d she says. That is not pessimistic, it's just a simple fact.   Fifty fifty philosophy  Photoshop and Illustrator are Gauckler's most important tools. They are her yin and yang, together one. Crisp, friendly, simple vector forms populate fierce, adult, complex photomontages. Gauckler likes to alternate pixels with vectors. Text with image. Photo realism with graphic abstraction. Stagnation with movement. Funny with sad. Meaning with nonsense. Absurdism with logic. Colour with black-and-white. Never has the one a lead over the other, too much yes automatically leads to no. Today a commercial commission, tomorrow an autonomous project with Pleix. This counterbalancing of opposites is incorporated not only in method or medium but also in the work itself, in what you see when you look at it. After a complex, overloaded collage landscape consisting of countless photo fragments each of which detached and put in the right place with great patience comes a supersimple, abstract, monochrome shape, a blob with two little eyes, put onto the screen in two seconds. Nonsense, ridiculous, funny guy. There is Zen in her embracing these opposites (which she herself does not see as opposites). Putting things into perspective is essential; humour is her trademark. Gauckler just as easily invents a fake religion as new methods to attain happiness.   Breeding images  Gauckler does not touch pen or pencil when creating an image. Indeed, she hardly ever uses her digital drawing tools. If she needs a circle (drawing one requires no more than half a second), she scans her worksheet for one. She composes her images through sampling and copying. Her point of departure is something that she puts right in the centre of her worksheet. That could be an image but just as easily text. Around it are pictures (a great many pictures indeed!) crowding along the edges of the image waiting for Genevi\u00e8ve to spot them. She drags them to the centre of the sheet, into the artwork \u2013 damaged and all, for she chops, traces, hacks, and mutates like Dr Frankenstein until she has obtained the parts she is looking for. She crossbreeds images. In l'arbre g\u00e9nialogique (her comic book) there is the sentence: 'Ce spectacle de duplication \u00e0 l'infini \u00e9tait d'une extr\u00eame beaut\u00e9'(This spectacle of infinite duplication was of rare beauty), and it is \u2013 although taken out of context \u2013 as if she is speaking about the very creation of images, her work, and her oeuvre. Sampled reproduction. A universe that like a benign virus is spreading everywhere, contaminating everything.   More, more, more  Gauckler's many travels and the multitude of photos she has made have in 2007 resulted in a publication and an exhibition entitled Around the world. One of the collages in Around the World, Food, is exhibited in Food Chain. It is a huge pile of junk food, cakes, pizzas, body parts, garbage, worms, sausages, cheese, and disgusting sandwich spread \u2013 the whole lot carefully cut out in Photoshop, a tower dripping with fat, reaching to the skies. Tiny people are standing around looking at it. They are amazed. They take photographs.  The collage represents our degenerated Western society, our typical relationship with food, our 'society of too much'. It is good to see that Gauckler immediately counterbalances this Western perception with an Eastern one. Equilibrium.    Gauckler is inspired by places of sacrifice, temples, and altars. She loves the colourful, profuse aesthetics of these places, the bustle, and the symbolism. In Asia, food is regarded as valuable, a sign of affluence. Something you offer to the gods, or to your ancestors, something you hold in deep reverence.    In the centre of MU, Gauckler has created a Food Altar, a mysterious dark spot where music sounds and little scraps of paper saying 'Disco rules' and 'Pizza respect' litter the floor. Here you can find cakes, cookies, rice, and worms. And here you can worship the God of Consumption under the watchful eye of an eternally jumping character. The Gaucklerian way of believing is funny, her religion palatable.   Yum yuck  Genevi\u00e8ve Gauckler likes to give advice. Advice is useful, practical, and instructional. Visitors to Food Chain will therefore come across a great many educational plates answering all kinds of questions with regard to eating habits. Ice cream for instance, is bad. Sitting in a chair contemplating an overripe pear and meditating is good. Having a potato character as a friend is good, too. Understandable, because they are both yellow. Broccoli, on the other hand, is violent. Too green. Of course, such gems of advice might come in handy, you never know.",

Contrasts the Parisian artist and performer ZEVS (1977) likes to work with, as they are available in any city. Mixing these in the streets with visible and often invisible paint, ZEVS creates subtle yet poignant artworks. Clad in a conspicuous yellow oilskin suit and wearing a leopard mask, he takes over power and induces people to see and experience things, albeit for a short while, in a different way. ZEVS developed the project ZTUNNEL especially for GLOW 2007 in Eindhoven.   In ZTUNNEL, he ties together a number of lines from his earlier work. Not only does he spray his tags with paint that is invisible by day, as he did earlier along the banks of the Seine, but he also arrests the shadows of passers-by, the way he did with the shadows of street furniture and cars in cities ranging from Paris to New York and Berlin to Rotterdam.   ZEVS, for that matter, does not stand criminals or terrorists against the wall in the Vestdijktunnel but innocent passers-by. Even so, his performance succeeds in making the current level of security and imminent danger in the streets, and in particular in unsafe areas such as tunnels, tangible to high extent.  His 'detainees' allow him to literally take away their shadow in an act which leaves no traces at all by daytime. It is only in the evening that they start lighting up, the ghosts of the Vestdijktunnel. At night, they populate the tunnel like the afterimages of all the living creatures that passed through it by daytime, made visible to the human eye by the black light tubes that during GLOW replace the ordinary lighting in the tunnel. In this way, a spot that is usually sinister and creepy by night becomes a bustling and crowded place. When the new day dawns and the tubes are replaced again, no trace is left of what went on at night. For his intelligent play with the codes of graffiti and light art, ZEVS draws inspiration from the Antropom\u00e9tries by artist Yves Klein, and the mysterious shadows of poles, plants, and stones that remained after the A-Bomb on Hiroshima.",

Here, all tastes are catered for: it is a website and an art project, a series of exhibitions and do-it-yourself assignments. It is image, text, and sound; it is film, photography, and performance. And most important of all, it is accessible to anyone who wants to contribute to it.  Five years ago, in 2002, Miranda July and Harrell Fletcher initiated  www.learningtoloveyoumore.com. On this website, the two American artists formulate creative commonplace assignments that can be carried out and sent in by everyone. Examples of assignments are: #1 make a child's outfit in an adult size, #16 make a paper replica of your bed, #27 take a picture of the sun, #32 draw a scene from a movie that made you cry, #48 make the saddest song, or #58 record the sound that is keeping you awake at night.  These reports, by now more than five thousand,         are sent in and posted on the website. This makes www.learningtoloveyoumore.com not only an extensive archive, but also a database containing an immense range of various quality levels of artistic views and solutions. Vulnerable and extremely private, but also moving and unexpectedly associative in nature, virtually every one of them touches on a desire to visualize shared interests.   For Miranda July LTLYM functions as an inspirational source. Once a performance artist, she wrote, directed, and starred in the film Me and You and Everyone We Know (2004), with which she scored a movie theatre world hit. Just like her recently published book of short stories No One Belongs Here More Than You (2007), which also appeared in a Dutch translation at De Bezige Bij, the movie testifies to the uniqueness of her style of imagery. A style that, as she herself claims, is fed by and has developed in a special way thanks to Learning To Love You More.    The same holds for Harrell Fletcher. In his work, which is always socially committed, he too prefers to focus on ordinary people in ordinary surroundings. His most well-known project, however, is The American War, a recent installation that in times of wars in the Middle East expresses a very personal view on the role of America in the Vietnam War.  After earlier LTLYM presentations during the New York Whitney Biennial, in the Seattle Art Museum, and the Wattis Institute in San Francisco, the first exhibition of Learning to Love You More in Europe will be on view this summer in MU in Eindhoven. The organization of this project is given as an assignment to nine young curators from the California College of the Arts (CCA) in San Francisco. In collaboration with the two artists, a large number of the nearly two thousand reporters, and MU, they will stage the most extensive presentation of the results so far. The exhibition runs parallel to the publication of the first LTLYM book by the international publishing house Prestel. This book and Moranda July's new book of short stories will be available at MU.   www.harrellfletcher.com  www.mirandajuly.com  www.www.learningtoloveyoumore.com",

In the past ten years, Los Angeles-based McFetridge has created in his free work and in his commissions a unique imagery, which is detailed and abstract at the same time. Full of hands and teeth, objects and animals, skaters and bikers.   \u201cAs a graphic artist, you're sort of swimming in a void. It's really simple to make cool stuff, there's so much cool stuff going round day in day out that it's getting boring.\u201d Geoff McFetridge sees himself as a merchant in icons. \u201cTake the Yeti. I've made dozens of them over the years. In fact, I have reduced the bigfoot to virtually nothing. Even so, no matter how I keep reducing the image, it remains recognizable. That's how I attract people; then I give it all a twist and start playing the perception game.   Born in Canada, but trained at the California Institute of the Arts, McFetridge won public acclaim as a designer when he was still a student. For two years, he was art director of the famous underground Beastie Boys magazine Grand Royal. Since then he has worked for numerous clients ranging from Nike, Pepsi, and St\u00fcssy to Burton, Girl and 2K/Gingham. He made clips for Plaid, Simian, and recently also for The Whitest Boy Alive, and he created film title sequences for The Virgin Suicides and Adaptation. He is one of the Beautiful Losers, and makes solo exhibitions from Los Angeles to Paris and from London to Tokyo. 'Bend the Void. The Space between Yeah and Yes' is his first large solo exhibition in the Netherlands.   While McFetridge's work sometimes literally shows its sharp edges, it is equally often imbued with a keen sense of humour. \u201cHumour is the most solid base to build on. Humour travels fast and without effort. I take pleasure in making people smile about a logo.\u201d For his commissions as well as for his free art, McFetridge draws inspiration from the huge stack of sketchbooks he collected over the years. \u201cAs a designer, you produce so much waste material. At least ten rough sketches precede every design. It's such a waste to throw these away. I keep them all, and from time to time, I pick out a word of a line of approach from them, which inspires me into making something new. That's how you can build a pathway for your own brain.\u201d",

Headscarves and burqas may have created quite a stir in recent years, but they are undeniably everyday garments and therefore trend-sensitive. Political and religious discussions aside, Muslimas present themselves in this project as ordinary young women and girls with their own ideas, tastes, preferences, references, opinions, and considerations with regard to fashion and clothing. Muslimas are fashion-conscious and they experience their clothing rules just like other Dutch girls who want to or have to comply with clothing rules, latest fashion crazes, or trends. Muslimas do not wear identical uniforms. Even when Muslimas wear headscarves, it's the differences that are the most conspicuous: the various ways in which headscarves are wrapped, the combinations with other garments, the colours, these aspects all tell different and unique stories. After all, the backgrounds of the Muslim girls are all very different and so is the level of their commitment to their religion.  The project MSLM, developed and produced by Mama in Rotterdam and presented in Eindhoven by MU, consists of an exhibition and a glossy publication. The editors of this magazine, which is entirely designed in fashion style, are all young Muslimas. It goes without saying that this magazine is for sale during the exhibition. To be able to present the exhibition, Mama and MU have joined forces with the young artists' initiative WEI. WEI is housed in a retail premises with large shop windows, downstairs in the Ventose flat, which is precisely the ambiance the exhibition needs. During the exhibition, fashion shows, lectures, and workshops will take place on specific Friday evenings.",

        "en_page_text": "Robots. Those little metal men, clanking and rattling steel skeletons moving along haltingly, set into motion by electrodes and wires, pneumatic and hydraulic joints? Yes, and Amorphic Robot Works directed by the American artist Chico MacMurtie has built more than two-hundred of them in the past fifteen years. With these robots, MacMurtie has gained international recognition as one of the world's greatest robot artists. However, recent investigations into the human condition and moving sculptures set him on a different track. Besides the usually heavy as well as fragile steel skeletons, MacMurtrie discovered and is actually currently exploring the possibilities of lightweight synthetics, plastics, and injection moulded joints. The result is a series of extremely lightweight robots: Inflatable Bodies. They do not only refer to human and animal bones, but to muscles as well. MacMurtrie's first series of sixteen robots bears the name Inflatable Birds.   In the course of his career, Mexican-American artist MacMurtrie has gained much insight into the essence of movement, and movement disconnected from its biological source. \u201cThe simple actions that we perform almost automatically are charged with an altogether different significance if they're executed by a creature that's struggling to do with great difficulty what comes natural to us.\u201d MacMurtrie believes that his machines, whose only goal is to grow, move, and interact, will help us reflect on the essence of living biological systems. \u201cAn important thing, which we in our robotic era, in the epoch of automation in which machines are taking over virtually all aspects of human life and work, seem to lose sight of.\u201d   Uninflated, the Inflatable Birds fit in a suitcase, but unpacked and by means of little tubes connected to a compressor that provides them with the indispensable oxygen and gas, they come to life. Within a couple of minutes, the arms fill up with air, folding out like the wings of a bird. The electronic hinge in the centre makes them move in a slow and irresistibly beguiling way. Imagine seeing a flock of sixteen of them 'flying' through the space in single file. When after some time the wings deflate, they dip down, forming a giant white spider walking through the space.   \u201cMore than any other project I've done up to now, the Inflatable Bodies underscore my respect for nature,\u201d says MacMurtrie. \u201cBesides, they also allow the interaction between artwork and human being to become even more intimate. They are playful and soft, their lightweightedness makes them easily transportable, and as they are fully functional in a floating as well as a static position on the floor, they can create a direct relation with the audience.\u201d MacMurtrie is therefore dreaming of developing his inflatable robots further into large-scale, interactive inflatable architecture.   Last year, the only place where all sixteen Inflatable Birds together were on view was Adelaide, Australia. Another recent project of Amorphic Robot Works is The Totemobile, a Citro\u00ebn DS that in three stages unfurls into an anthropomorphic totem; a spectacular organic transformer rising to a full height of twenty metres. The robotic sculpture is built for the Citro\u00ebn Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es showroom. The exhibition in MU is not MacMurtrie's first exhibition in Eindhoven; years ago he exhibited a couple of mechanical robots in the artists' collective 2B. Amorphic Robot Works is currently housed in an old church in Red Hook, Brooklyn. For more information and backgrounds www.cronos.net/~bk/amorphic",

        "en_page_text": "Canciones del mundo al rev\u00e9s sings in printed and cut-out paper and cardboard about the ever-growing divide between rich and poor, between power and powerlessness, between the US and Mexico. Paper-cut artist Swoon, whose home base is Brooklyn, New York, and stencil artist Poncho from the insurgent region of Chiapas and neighbouring Oaxaca in the southeast of Mexico, have joined forces to bring these issues to attention. Together they create a world of powerful survival, a world in which Western street art and Mexican murals have fused together to reveal the true face of one of the hotbeds of 21st century political activism.   Swoon and Poncho will especially for MU build a reversed world in which the people, poor though they may be, have not lost their human dignity. Their inspirational source is the satirical combativeness of the Latin-American writer Eduardo Galeano, whose book 'Patas Arribas, la escuela del mundo al rev\u00e9s' (translated in Dutch as 'Ondersteboven. De school van de omgekeerde wereld') appeared in the late nineties. Both the book, which is illustrated by the Mexican artist Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, and the installation by Swoon and Poncho, take a stand against the exploitation and inequality that are largely due to globalization and its concomitant, labour migration.   We in Europe know about the desperate attempts of African citizens to make it to 'fort Europe', but similar tragedies are taking place in the borderland between Mexico and the USA. Looking for work, large groups of people, particularly from the south of Mexico and mostly male, try to make their way to their wealthy neighbour, the US. They leave their wives and daughters behind in a desolate and destitute landscape.  As the women can hardly survive on what their families send them, they are forced to work hard themselves, slaving away in miserable, underpaid jobs. Many of these women make hand-stitched leather footballs. It takes a woman one full day to finish one football, for which she is paid less than one US dollar. The fastest-working women can do as many as twelve footballs a week, but even then, their wages do not exceed twelve US dollars. These women used to work on their own, which made them all the more vulnerable, so now they have united in a collective.   Supported by activist teachers, artists like Poncho, and Zapatistas, who would gladly replace the present conservative Mexican government by a more socialist-oriented political system, these women-collectives have recently been involved in a fierce struggle the impact of which reverberated in the Mexican parliament and reached the Dutch news bulletins.   Swoon, who owes her fame mainly to the person-sized, cutout paste-ups that she has since 2001 introduced in the streets of New York, learned about the severe hardship these Mexican women suffer in Chiapas during a long trek in the thick of the action. Tired of the busy New York art life \u2013 Swoon exhibited in Deitch Projects, PS1, Miami Art Basel, MOMA and other exhibition spaces\u2013 she went to Mexico to find new energy and real life. And real life she found, brutal and explicit. She also found an artistic tradition that showed affinity with her own working method, and a young artist she was enthusiastic to cooperate with.   When MU invited Swoon to make an installation, she grabbed the opportunity to tell the story of the women of Chiapas, to make their militant songs ring aloud and clear. She says that this project would be difficult to realize in both the US and Mexico. In Europe, however, the project would be successful in raising the reality to a higher level. Here, the portraits and songs of the women of Chiapas become metaphors for the increasingly distorted relationships occurring all over the world.   Canciones del mundo al rev\u00e9s thus promises to become Swoon's most political work so far. A reversed world that is nonetheless inhabited by real people, people who dance and work, live and sing.",

        "en_page_text": "What do bike messengers, graffiti artists, amateur soccer players, wild deer, and a controversial female photographer have in common? Not a lot, obviously, except for the fact that the American photographer and filmmaker Peter Sutherland has aimed his camera on them. It's his lens that creates the cohesion. The interactions can be witnessed in GAME, Sutherland's first retrospective, on view in MU in De Witte Dame in Eindhoven from January 26 up to and including February 25.   Sutherland, born in Ann Arbor Michigan, and raised in Colorado, has since 1998 lived and worked in New York City. A self-taught photographer, he has developed a sensitive eye and a personal style in which street and portrait photography, youth culture, and nature form an organic blend. Sutherland appears to have the gift to capture people, animals, and landscapes in images that are very direct and at the same time unaffectedly documentary. Yet in combination, these images are also capable of relating a wider-scoped narrative.   The core of GAME, Sutherland's first large solo presentation in Europe, and one in which all the lines in his work come together, is a photo series about the Chinatown Soccer Club. The members of this casual club of young New Yorkers, of whom Sutherland himself is not one of the least fanatic members, get together three mornings a week on a plot in Chinatown to play soccer for an hour or so. Summer and winter, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at least fourteen players are competing against each other, watched by local residents and passers-by, drifters, and the older Chinese who have proclaimed the adjoining basketball court a Tai Chi temple.   Many CSC players, a mix of Americans, Asians, and Europeans, appear to be artists and designers in everyday life. After the match, they fan out to their studios and offices, not until they've posed for Sutherland however, because to him the camera is an equally essential part of the 'game' as the ball.   Sutherland's photo series are inconceivable without his personal commitment to the Chinatown Soccer Club, and also his early morning cycle tours to the soccer plot are reflected in his work. Up to now, Sutherland's most well-known work is Pedal, a by now classic documentary film from 2001 about the raw life of bike messengers in New York. With a mild eye and a warm heart for the maverick heroism of the gritty life on two wheels in the congested streets and alleys of a fast-paced metropolis, Sutherlands tells the story of all those boys (and girls) who hit the pedals day in day out. A mixture between underground culture and livelihood, sport and work, Pedal takes the tradition of the best skateboard films further. This has induced Powerhouse Books to publish in 2006 a box containing this documentary film together with a photo book about the 2005 Cycle Messenger World Championships in New York. In the exhibition GAME, Pedal will be on view in the Netherlands for the first time.   This is also the case with a number of portraits from Sutherland's first book: Autograf. In the course of three years, Sutherland managed to persuade more than fifty active New York graffiti writers to pose before his lens. Mostly disguised and unrecognizable, all of them, from KAWS to Serf and from Claw to Fanta, agreed to add their tags to their portraits, which makes the link between the person and his work tighter than ever.   While the focus in Chinatown Soccer Club, Pedal and Autograf is on an entire movement, a subculture, Sutherland's most recent documentary film (made together with writer Jack Youngelson) hones in on only one person and her family. The film, entitled The Mother Project, follows the controversial yet much acclaimed photographer Tierney Gearon over a period of three years of her life. Lasting more than sixty minutes, the film delves deeply into the mysterious bonds between Tierney, her mother, and her children, the things that bind them and the things that drive them apart. Raw and direct, Gearon appears to be an ideal subject. The result is a very personal film that breaks through the conventions of an artist's documentary: not just talking heads, the work's supporters and opponents, and a visit to the studios, but a journey beyond the photographs. The camera zooms in on the photographer, her working method and her sources of inspiration, the artistic issues she is struggling with, and the unconventional nuclear family that will always be the be-all and end-all of her work.   Why Sutherland has followed Gearon so intensely and for such a long period can be explained from his own passion for the personal. He too balances in his images on the boundary between the personal and the universal. The theme of his book Coming Home for instance is the rugged landscape of his native ground. Huskies and foxes, deer and fireflies, snow and mountains, hides and lumberjacks evoke an almost romantic image of the American highland, which to him still is home, even after many years in Manhattan. This publication will be followed by a second book entitled Buckshots, in which not the city but nature features prominently. The heroes in this book are deer, not people. Sutherland, however, portrays them with a similar sensitivity; and he approaches them just as closely as he approached the graffiti writers. To him, these animals aren't just game. They are the non-domesticated, the animals that have remained free. However close they may at times approach civilization, they will never cross the boundaries. They are the ultimate spectators, always vigilant, keeping a close eye what's going on around them. They are soft and vulnerable, but also elusive. With his Buckshots, Sutherland, departing from a similar kind of fascination, builds as it were on the nightly deer portraits from the collection of Eric Kessels.   On the occasion of the exhibition GAME, a publication containing Sutherland's impressions and portraits of the Chinatown Soccer Club will be published by MU in collaboration with the Swiss art book publisher Nieves. The book, which counts 64 pages of full-colour photography, will be available at the exhibition.   More information on Peter Sutherland: www.nieves.ch/peter.html www.petersutherland.net",

Founded in the middle of the 1990s by designer/artist Michael Faulkner, D-Fuse (a play on words expressing both the fusion and the diffusion in the work) has developed into a versatile group of artists.   The collective consists of a small artistic core with Michael Faulkner still as the lynchpin, surrounded by a large number of kindred artists, designers, musicians, and architects. Depending on the project at hand, they join the collective temporarily and move away again, when the job is completed. This working method allows D-Fuse to be active in several disciplines without ever compromising its quality and artistic renewal. The collective's output varies from multimedia installations and audiovisual performances to mobile media, graphic work, time-based architecture, and film.   It is D-Fuse's ambition to continually broaden the scope of possibilities for digital art and to introduce this art to a wide audience in the most accessible way. In addition, D-Fuse makes regular contributions to the current discourse about the artistic applications of the newest as well as the more settled media. Though moving in the vanguard of technological art, D-Fuse will always bear in mind that technique in the arts is a means to an end, not the end itself.   The experiments carried out by D-Fuse contribute to the development of an individual language for the digital world. Their work is challenging; it provokes thoughts about experiencing art with more senses at the same time and on several levels simultaneously. D-Fuse prefers to work on the interface between image and sound.  Transmit is D-Fuse's first large solo presentation. As befits the multifaceted and multidisciplinary nature of the collective, the project comprises three parts.   The first part is a live performance in the Effenaar, with a performance by D-Fuse itself and a number of guests. Among these guests are world-famous sound artist Scanner (UK), Burnt Friedman and Jaki Liebezeit (GER) and Terrace (NL), the VJ collectives ACTOP (UK/E) and Visualkitchen (B) and VJ Oxygen and Michel Banabila (NL).The second part of Transmit is the exhibition in MU showing the full scope of D-Fuse's multimedial work. The core of the show is the installation SmallGlobal in which D-Fuse stages a mind-blowing representation of our world changing rapidly and irrevocably under the influence of consumerism. In addition, D-Fuse has built especially for MU a tunnel of light and sound.The third part of Transmit is a mini symposium that coincides with the global launch of the book A/V Audiovisual Art + VJ Culture by D-Fuse. The book and the accompanying DVD will appear (September 1, 2006) at the London publishing house Laurence King. The symposium is focused on the Dutch as well as on the international audience and will take place at the end of the project.",

Originally designed to be an undergarment meant to be worn under a shirt, the t-shirt has in the 20th century developed into a worldwide fashion item. It makes sense that artists, too, regard the cotton fabric as a suitable carrier for their artworks.   The Japanese/American company 2KbyGingham is one of the leading art and t-shirt suppliers in the world. For ten years now, they have been offering various young graphic designers and artist from all over the world the opportunity to make special prints for t-shirts. They know how to catch the street lingo in words and images that are understandable for everyone who comes across them. With 2K, shirt and print are no separate elements; they are inextricably linked to form a contemporary form of communication that allows young people in particular to speak a unique wordless language of their own, and express 'a thousand things'.  This is why MU in partnership with 2K is staging an exhibition this summer in which the boundaries between art and street scenes on t-shirts are investigated. Eighteen international artists and designers have each entered several original works that illustrate the way in which they build the bridge that allows them to communicate on shirts as well.   From Yoshitomo Nara's Harmless Kitty to Geoff McFetridge's Snowman and from the ANTI-shirt by Experimental Jetset to Marc Atlans Flavors in the most tasty colours. Other participating artists are: Barry McGee, Richard Prince, Donald Baechler, Tomoo Gokita, Stereotype*, M/M, David Shrigley + Shynola, French, Jeff Canhan, Josh Petherick, Katsuo Design, Cody Hudson, Kiyoshi Kuroda and Misaki Kawai. The exhibition design is by Experimental Jetset. The exhibition is curated by Taka Kawachi from New York.   The exhibition is accompanied by a free full-colour newspaper featuring more than twenty life-size 2K shirts, designed by Experimental Jetset and produced in cooperation with the Eindhovens Dagblad. On the occasion of the show, 2K will introduce a specially sealed collector's shirt by Experimental Jetset.   A Thousand Things kicks off on Friday July 28 from 20.00 onwards in the presence of various participating artists. The exhibition is on view daily up to and including August 20 in MU in De Witte Dame, Emmasingel 20 in Eindhoven. Open: Mon through Fri 10.00-18.00, Sat 11.00-17.00, Sun 13.00-17.00.   During the film showings by Film1 Pleinbioscoop on the Lichtplein, MU will be open until 22.00 from Wed August 16 through Sat August 19.

In this thirty-day project in MU, Baas and Van Midde will bring to life a whole series of furniture. Every Friday evening, the pieces of furniture are being transformed into characters in an ever-livelier performance. These performances will be filmed and the recordings incorporated into the exhibition.       Humankind is so busy communicating oral messages. Yet, eighty percent of what we're 'saying' is non-verbal in nature, only a mere twenty percent is verbal. According to Maarten Baas, there's a lot we could communicate without producing speech. Perhaps even without moving, just standing still in one posture.  The step to the non-verbal communication of the things around us is quickly made. \u201cWe're surrounding us with products that can in general just assume one position: the position devised by the designer. Most pieces of furniture emanate power: sturdy, strong, symmetrical, and sleek. When you look at furniture in that way, most pieces of furniture could be described as a kind of '\u00dcberprodukte'. Probably, that's what sells best...\u201d  But do we really want to be surrounded by this kind of furniture, asks Baas. \u201cThere must be different kinds of furniture. Where is the sweet furniture? The sad furniture? The cheerful furniture? The underdogs? What would happen if the shapes of furniture would no longer be static but moveable? What if they could speak? What would they want to communicate?\u201d  With this notion of 'body language' in mind, Maarten Baas wants to investigate what furniture would have told us, if they'd been able to communicate with us. What emotions are locked up in what shapes.       Baas has selected a series of emotionally charged pieces of furniture, which he will bring to life in partnership with director and performer Joris van Midde of De Kwekerij Theaterproducties. Van Midde produces performances in which actors, dancers and musicians link very diverse emotions and characters to the furniture Baas selected. From static objects and stage props, the pieces of furniture become actors in a play that will continue to develop on five Friday evenings in a row.  The film recordings will be incorporated in the exhibition, creating an ever-growing pile-up of scenes. Not one single piece of furniture remains untouched or without character or force.  Once you've attended these performances, you'll never look at a chair or stool, table or cupboard in the same way again.       Maarten Baas (1978) graduated from the Design Academy in 2002 with an eye-popping project: a burnt armchair and a chandelier finished of with a protective epoxy coating to get them ready for a new lease of life. Everyone fell in love with the scorched beauty of 'Smoke'. Ever since, Maarten Baas is hot. He has had exhibitions from Milan to Tokyo and from New York to Paris.       Joris van Midde (1969) has been active for some years now on the fringes of what is called theatre. In a mix of performance, dance, music, and video, De Kwekerij is constantly searching for a new form in which the location plays a vital role. De Kwekerij has a taste for a dark and dismal atmosphere. Often vicious or somewhat morbid, but sombre, no, never.",

        "en_page_text": "Ari Marcopoulos (1957) is a photographer and filmmaker. Born in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, he currently lives and works in Sonoma in rural northern California. However, he shoots his photographs everywhere, on the snow-capped mountaintops of the world, in the trail of a small tribe of professional snowboarders, in the garden at home, along Japan's rugged coastlines or in the streets of New York. Exhibition space MU in De Witte Dame in Eindhoven is proud to be the first in Europe to present from March 17 till April 16 the exhibition Flow, a comprehensive overview of Marcopoulos' work.   In more than twenty-five years, Marcopoulos has built an oeuvre populated by the most heterogeneous characters ranging from world-famous artists such as Andy Warhol and Jean Michel Basquiat, pop heroes such as the Beastie Boys, top snowboarders and skaters to anonymous street kids, rappers and his own sons and wife. Typical of Marcopoulos' oeuvre is the intimateness that pervades all of his works.  Whatever company he finds himself in, he is never an outsider, never merely an onlooker like so many of his fellow-photographers.  Marcopoulos belongs to the world he registers, he knows the people in front of his lens personally and intimately. And they know him. They trust him. And their trust enables him to reach beyond the poses and the shallow looks and grasp the essence of everyday appearances. That's where heroes become ordinary boys and ordinary boys become heroes, where boredom and fun, passion and friendship are taking shape.   Marcopoulos' intimate family portraits and panoramic landscapes are markedly different from his popular works of street, underground and extreme sports scenes, yet they all share the typical Marcopoulos aesthetic. In the course of time, Marcopoulos, autodidact and never particularly interested in the technical aspects of photography, learned to handle the medium expertly. He makes use of Photoshop and pocket camera without ever compromising his principles. Besides, he rarely finds his sources and kindred spirits among photographers but in other disciplines such as architecture and visual arts. And in other epochs: he is especially fascinated by the portrait and genre painters of the Dutch Golden Age.   In the USA and Japan, Marcopoulos is a big name, but in Europe his work is so far less well-known. The exhibition Flow is certain to bring about a change in this situation. Supported by a size-wise rather limited yet thematically all-embracing overview of the foundations of his photographic oeuvre, Marcopoulos offers in MU a relevant overview of the most recent developments in his work.   In well over seventy photographs, he brings the intimate nature of his work to perfection only to abandon it completely somewhat later. Even though people are generally the leitmotiv in his work, sometimes they have vanished from sight. What remains are endless landscapes full of ice, water and clouds.  In general, Marcopoulos' closest photographic objects are the people around him, his wife Jennifer Goode and his sons Cairo and Ethan. As a spectator, you get an eyeful of them, including the daily misadventures, scratches and bruises, bloody noses and measles that make a (young) human being a human being. Razor-sharp and as in a moment of utter stillness, Marcopoulos catches the little aches of human existence, the ones that you rarely see but infallibly recognize.   The bumps and bruises of his sons are in sharp contrast with the extreme injuries of the snowboarders and skaters in Marcopoulos' oeuvre. His sons' scratches are symbols of life's gentle teachings \u2013 What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger - , but the deep scars and broken bones of the tough kids defying the snow and the streets are worn like real trophies. Proudly parading up and down, they lift their shirts or show off their braces while they have their photographs taken.   In the course of the years, Marcopoulos has shot many thousands of action photos and films for well-known magazines such as Transworld Snowboarding, and various large snowboard brands. In that area, he ranks among the best in the world. In his free work, however, he was like a kind of cultural anthropologist always focussed on life among the kicks of the small group of free-and-easy top sporters, whom he soon enough came to know personally. Therefore, instead of spectacular or stylized jumps, he shows you people bored out of their skulls in desolate hotel rooms, waiting until the umpteenth snowstorm has blown out and the chopper can take off. The games and porn, drugs and booze that help kill the time. Sunburnt noses, swathed necks, exhausted bodies after a day full of 'transitions and exits' from summits covered in fresh, white snow.",

To make the public at large aware of the as yet little known artistic developments, MU and De Krabbedans have organized the exhibition HIER2. As many as twenty artists under 35, all of them living in the region Eindhoven and working at a high level of quality, have been given the opportunity to present themselves in the first two months of 2006 in MU and De Krabbedans. They could easily be regarded as a new generation of artists who so far have only been able to present themselves on occasion and in a non-coherent way.   HIER2 offers these artists for the first time not only the space to show their work in a professional setting to a wide public, but also the opportunity to present new work and introduce expressions of cross-fertilization and interchange. The work of the twenty artists will be displayed in MU and De Krabbedans, two exhibition spaces in a characteristic building called De Witte Dame. As the exhibition is split up into two three-week time blocks and organized in two separate spaces, there will be room enough for the five artists in each group to do their own thing without any restrictions.   HIER2 is about the here and now, about living art. Therefore, all participants are explicitly challenged to take their work a step further, an approach which links up seamlessly with the enterprising do-it-yourself mentality of most of the Eindhoven artists.   Just like the first edition of HIER in 2002, HIER2 is rock-solid proof for the fact that the cultural climate in Eindhoven is definitely not ruled by design and technology alone. Some of the participating artists have deliberately chosen for an autonomous art career after graduating from the Design Academy.  Together with a number of diehard painters, conceptual constructors and imaginative photographers from various other art academies in Brabant and other regions, they will present in HIER2 a multifaceted picture of the youngest generation of artists who settled in South-east Brabant in the past couple of years. Even so, it's definitely not only the postcode which they have in common, because also in terms of mentality and the zest for work all participants are firmly rooted in Eindhoven.   The ten following artists present their work at MU:  Erosie, Gijs Pape, Paul Segers, Miriam Temme, Griet Menschaert, Gijs van Bon, Snodevormgevers, Sebastiaan Dijk, Bram Hermens, Lotte van Lieshout, John van Litsenburg   De Krabbedans  Karina van Heck, Marissa van Mourik, Rachida Post, Anouk Bax, Freek Lomme, Jobina Tinnemans, Annette Born, Berry Sanders, Rob Looman, Jeroen Vrijsen",

        "en_page_text": "Han Hoogerbrugge (41) studied painting at the Rotterdam Academy of Arts from 1982 to 1987. After graduating he starts working as a visual artist in the conventional sense of the word, doing paintings, drawings, installations and sculptures. In 1996 he draws his self-portrait as a comic strip for the very first time. In that same year he starts exploring the Internet and starts a website called Modern Living. After posting the comic on his website, he realizes that the Internet isn't the appropriate medium for a static comic. When he discovers the potential of gif animations he starts making small animations for the Internet: the Neurotica series.   With the installation ZOO, premiering now in MU, Hoogerbrugge embarks on a new challenge. In a style similar to his short internet animations, he is going to create an entirely new work, which will be projected full-scale on eight screens of three by two metres. The interiors projected on the eight screens are reminiscent of a hybrid hospital treatment room, wind tunnel, test chamber and cage. In these spaces, boxed-in, withdrawn people show us their tics, neuroses and compulsions.   Web animations presuppose one-to-one communication. In the ideal situation, the user plays and responds to the animation works on his own familiar computer in his own familiar environment. He decides how long the animation is going to continue and how often an action will be repeated. There's no-one looking over his shoulder, the user is free to do what he wants, he's the one in complete control. Via his computer, the user has 24/7 global access to the work.   The visitors of the installation 'ZOO' on the other hand, are invited to watch the animations from a suitable distance as if they were exotic 'species', rarely to behold in real life. A situation quite different from the home situation, therefore. The user becomes a visitor; the intimacy of the familiar home screen has vanished. The visitor is in an environment that is alien to him, he's never alone and he has no control over the progress of the animations. The public confrontation with human inadequacies makes the experience all the more embarrassing and heartrending. Still, it's not going to be a passive spectacle. As the animations are projected on an octagon of screens, it will be impossible for the visitor to view all the animations at once. Driven by the feeling that he's missing out on something, he will walk around the space: what's happening on the other screens? This feeling of unease will be heightened by the sound supporting the animations. What kind of sound is that, where does it come from?   A physical tour along the total installation in MU offers an entirely different confrontation with Hoogerbrugge's work. As the new work is presented in a gallery setting, it has gained a completely new impact and expressive strength. In addition to this large-sized installation, the exhibition in MU will also contain prints and web animations of these images on four stand-alone PCs.",

In 1999,  Yukinori Maeda (1971) set up COSMIC WONDER in Osaka, which remains to be the base of operations for him and his 11 coworkers. Maeda has deliberately chosen not to establish creative operations in hyperactive Tokyo as he finds Osaka, a city with an almost Eastern European atmosphere, without any distractions or pretensions, the best place to concentrate. Maeda studied architecture in Kyoto, before he decided to design garments instead of buildings. Clothing being closer to human body than buildings, he may have found his field of expression in its intimacy with people's daily lives. Maeda: 'Which seems superfluous and absurd, is often to me the most beautiful and fascinating aspect.' In a recent interview he defines his design attitude as 'to find the truth after I found contradiction.'    COSMIC WONDER occupies a unique position within the Japanese art and fashion world. While many ontemporary Japanese artists favour a flashy, colourful style dominated by influences from manga, pop culture and games, Maeda deliberately turns his back on these manifestations of aggressive and hollow excitement.   Maeda's fascination is found in the traditional Japanese values that are based on the concepts of harmony and purity. Even his diet reflect this philosophy of life, drawn more to organically grown and basic but well studied food. On his desk in his Osaka studio, stack of book sits there as his current inspiration, yet also mysteriously unite in visual aesthetics. No computer, and no telephone in his immediate vicinity. The Osaka studio and shop cohabits in a carefully crafted building with COSMIC WONDER aesthetics, and glows in pure white with florescent light. Recently, a hole for a plant growing from underneath was added to their desks. The balance of nature and thorough control sits serenely in COSMIC WONDER's agenda.   Since 1999, COSMIC WONDER has participated in the Paris fashion week with performance heavy presentation. During the fashion week, the label had a couple of smaller scale exhibitions in Parisian galleries but never before a large-scale solo exhibition in Europe. The exhibition at MU presents various installations, video, photos and sound. It is not a display of 40 dummies showing 40 garments but an overall work combining existing and new creations. The projects COSMIC WONDER will deliver especially for this exhibition include new video works and further exploration of recurring theme \"magic village\". Naturally, some elements and ideas from the COSMIC WONDER's installation at both \"magic village\" Spring/Summer 05 and Fall/Winter 06 collection will come into play and specific interpretation of the space MU will further contribute to this young artist's creative endeavor. Maeda's fashion identity COSMIC WONDER will carry out its own journey and video work will be staged in close cooperation with the Japanese artist Yuki Kimura (1971). Kimura has been a visual contributor to many of COSMIC WONDER's printed matter and video works. A COSMIC WONDER publication, edited and designed in close cooperation with Purple in Paris, is being released in conjunction with the exhibition. On earlier occasions, MU worked with Purple on the release of \"Kim's Bedroom\" and \"Mark Borthwick\" books. This Purple Book is not a catalogue of the COSMIC WONDER show but rather an artist book. It contains texts, poetry, photos and collages. Christophe Brunnquell will design the publication.   The exhibition will open with a performance by Yukinori Maeda in close cooperation with Yoshimi, known from the illustrious Japanese bands Boredoms and ooioo, Hisham Bharoocha, Tsuka, Stephen Sprott, and Yuki Kimura (as VJ).",

        "en_page_text": "For the first time ever 12 Neenstars will be in the same space at the same time. Neen Today is a meeting of international artists. They will create new images in order to realize an ever-changing show which will be \"perfect\" only for one minute, at April 4th 2004 at 4:44 PM. Before and after this special minute, the show will be a work in progress.   Different pieces will be projected on 6 screens in random order. The center of the space will be a mountain of pillows. This set-up allows the visitors to spy over the shoulders of the creators and get an idea of the development of artworks created on the screen and meant for the screen. Neen Today is an important moment for Neen. Even though the artists belong to the same network and create artworks that demonstrate a certain affinity, the majority of them have never met. It will be interesting to see what this clash will lead to.   Neentoday is a mirror for the Neen Movement, a moment where we see what we are.        Neen is a concept that we discovered in late 2000. We bought the actual name, from Lexicon, a Branding Company based in California that has also invented \"Pentium\" and \"Powerbook\". Neen is about a new type of feelings we all have while we are busy with our new smart toys, the  computers, videogames etc. Most of the things we do with them are Telic, (Telic means expressing purpose, such as \"I am driving my car to Los Angeles\"), but in some special circumstances, we are in a Neen mood and if we isolate it and repeat it, then we can create Neen Art and Neen Theories that are very fresh and original.  Up to now, we have created a new imagery based on websites and animations (samples can be found at www.neen.org ) and a chain of Neen theories such as the Fourfortyfour Theory that is about people meeting for just a minute in perfect islands of time such as 22.22 or 1.23 ( www.fourfortyfour.com ) .  There are about 20 Neen creators that we know of today; some are artists, some composers, architects, fashion designers or even computerprogrammers. Neen is not a static thing, we cannot really put it down in words, when we will be able to do so, it will become Telic. Like the old Miracle of Jesus walking on the water: if he will come back today and he will do it again, it will be sort of \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\", and if instead, he starts swimming, most people will refuse to believe that he is actually Jesus but it will be more cool. Neen is a Miracle in reverse.  Searching for Neen is a contradiction. If you look for it you will not find it. Neen will come to you if you are lucky. Telic is when beauty finds a place and all the pieces of the puzzle come together: there is a reason for their connection. Neen is beauty in itself.        The Internet is for visual artists a platform to do their thing without making compromises and to show the output to the whole world. It presents an opportunity to move freely and to introduce one's work without the interference of gallery-owners and curators. Never before has there been a medium which is so simple to handle and so easily accessible. Television companies have tried to realize this with open TV, which hasn't been as successful as the Internet. The Internet is very instant, one works on the same medium one exhibits on. The maker is entirely autonomous while literally hundreds of thousands of people can watch the artworks. So it's not surprising that art is created on this platform, a new kind of art, not academic but free and fleeting. As the Internet is such an open medium, there's also a lot of rubbish on it and many people find it difficult to find an entrance. Besides, the medium might prove a technological barrier for the not-so-young members of the art public: they are not familiar with computers and the ins and outs of the net.

        "en_page_text": "Mike Mills was born in Los Angeles as the son of a retired museum director. Mills was educated at the Cooper Union in New York and lived in NYC for 15 years. He returned to California to create his own production company, The Directors Bureau, with his friend and fellow director Roman Coppola and with Sofia Coppola.  Art cinema Plaza Futura will show a compilation of the short films, commercials and videos by Mike Mills on sunday january 18.   In his designs, Mike Mills winks at the past yet manages to retain a sense of smart, simple modernity. His style is extremely diverse, ranging from abstract-retro(with explosions of colours) to simple line-drawings and botched-up photography. Mike Mills creates and at the same time comments on popular culture, which makes his work unique. His work has been categorised as 'pop art for now people.' \u201cIt's fun to be archival about trash\u201d, he says about his obsession with 70's kid culture. \u201cI work with the objects I find on my way, I'm not an artist who works out things in his head. I am interested in popular culture, things that are already there and that I can put together in a botched-up way. To me, that means coming up with something new. Is it art? That's a question I don't lose much sleep over'.   Mills has left an indelible mark on the visual language of our times. His work, though hard to categorise (nuevo-retro?, docu-fiction?) speaks both to and for our times and the cultural confusion that has become such an essential part of our lives. \u201cI think that my work is just symptomatic of our time. I grew up as a skateboarder in an ambience of punk bands and that's a very entrepreneurial community. You learn to understand that all these creative expressions are not as separate as they seem to be.\u201d Mills also mentions to be influenced by Charles Eames and Dick Bruna. \u201dEames made furniture, we all know that, but he was also into architecture, films, exhibitions and toys. That's a great example of cross-disciplinary work.\u201d   Deformer, one of Mills' first films, is a documentary report on skater/artist Ed Templeton. In 1999 Mills made his first short film called Architecture and Reassurance. The film is a representation of the dreams of a teenage girl living in utopian suburbia in Los Angeles, who is convinced that the visual homogeneity of the neighbourhood is a reflection of the happiness and togetherness of its inhabitants. In his most recent short film, Paperboys, Mills registers the daily lives of six boys in rural Minnesota. Among Mills' other films are a short film documenting the world of thought of jazz composer Ornette Coleman and a short promotional film for Marc Jacobs. For the French pop duo Air, Mills made the 45 minutes black and white documentary Eating, Sleeping, Waiting & Playing. In this documentary, Mills abandons the typical tour diary approach and asks the audience nonsensical, ridiculous questions instead of the band. Mike Mills is currently working on his first Hollywood movie based on Thumbsucker, a book by Walter Kern. This film will premiere in the summer of 2004. For the show in MU, Mills will make 20 short movies.",
