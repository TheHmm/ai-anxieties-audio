  <p>Welcome to MUMORIES,</p>
  <p>An audio installation where you are invited to share your memories of MU. These memories are collected and form a living digital audio archive that can eventually be listened to on site but also online. The growing collection of MUMORIES made possible by this interface literally gives voice to the immaterial impact a cultural practice like MU's has on visitors. As part of the research project <a href="https://networkcultures.org/goinghybrid/" target="blank"><i>Going Hybrid</i></a>, we are zooming in on the question of how to make archives a living, breathing entity rather than a silent material collection of the past. This installation is an initial hybrid prototype around narrated memories of visitors, hence the name MUMORIES.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to be a part of this growing and living archive, we invite you to start sharing. Don't worry, if it's your first time at MU or you don't remember much, you can always opt for a prompt-driven interaction, as opposed to archive-driven. We look forward to hearing your MUMORIES.</p>
  <p>MUMORIES is a collaboration of MU with <a href="https://thehmm.nl/" target="blank">The Hmm</a>, <a href="https://hackersanddesigners.nl" target="blank">Hackers & Designers</a> and <a href="https://varia.zone" target="blank">Varia</a> as part of the <i>Going Hybrid</i> research project, a 24 month-long research project into the future of hybridity for the cultural field, from <a href="https://networkcultures.org/" target="blank">Institute of Network Cultures</a> and <a href="https://www.wdka.nl/" target="blank">Willem de Kooning Academy/Piet Zwart Institute</a>, generously supported by <a href="https://regieorgaan-sia.nl/" target="blank">RAAK/SIA</a>.</p>
